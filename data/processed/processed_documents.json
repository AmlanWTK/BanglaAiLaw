Whenever it shall be necessary to make any inquiry or examination in connection with a projected\ncanal or with the maintenance of an existing canal, or with a projected flood-embankment, or with the\nmaintenance of an existing flood-embankment, any canal-officer or other person acting under the\ngeneral or special orders of a canal-officer may enter upon such land as he may think necessary for the\npurpose, and may exercise all powers and do all things in respect of such lands as he might exercise\nand do if the Government had issued a notification under the provisions of section 4 of the Land\nAcquisition Act, 1894, to the effect that land in that locality is likely to be needed for a public purpose;\nand may set upon and maintain water-gauges, and do all other things necessary for the prosecution of\n\nsuch inquiry and examination.\n\n34. Such canal-officer or other person may also enter upon any land, building or village-channel on\naccount of which any water-rate is chargeable for the purpose of inspecting or regulating the use of the\n\nwater supplied, or of measuring the lands irrigated thereby or chargeable with a water rate, and of\n\n14/38\n\n30/08/2025\n\nPower to enter for\nrepairs, and to\nprevent accidents\n\nNotice to\noccupier of\nbuilding, etc.\n\nCompensation for\ndamage to land\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-35.html\n\nThe Irrigation Act, 1876\n\ndoing all things necessary for the proper regulation and management of the canal from which such\n\nwater is supplied.\n\n35.

When such canal-officer or person proposes, under the provisions of either of the three last\npreceding sections, to enter into any building or enclosed court or garden attached to a dwelling-house\nnot supplied with water flowing from any canal, and not being adjacent to a flood embankment, he shall\npreviously give to the occupier of such building, court or garden such reasonable notice as the urgency\n\nof the case may allow.\n\n37. In every case of entry upon any land or building under section 7, section 33, section 34 or section\n35, the canal-officer or person making the entry shall ascertain and record the nature of any crop, tree,\nbuilding or other property to which damage has been done, and the extent of the damage done to any\nsuch property, and shall tender compensation to the proprietors or occupiers for all damage done to the\n\nsame by the entry or by any works executed.\n\nIf such tender is not accepted, the canal-officer shall refer the matter to the Collector, who shall\nthereupon give notice in writing to the person interested in such land and to the canal-officer, requiring\nthem to attend before him, on a date to be fixed in the notice, for the purpose of making inquiry as to\n\nthe amount of compensation.\n\n15/38\n\n30/08/2025\n\nAppeal from\nCollector's\ndecision to\ncommissioner\n\nGovernment to\nprovide means of\ncrossing canals\nand of drainage\n\nCollector to\ncertify to\nGovernment that\nmeans of\ncrossing canals\nand drainage\nhave been\nprovided\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-35.html\n\nThe Irrigation Act, 1876\n\n38.

Suitable means of crossing canals constructed or maintained at the cost of Government shall be\nprovided at such places as the Government thinks necessary for the reasonable convenience of the\ninhabitants of the adjacent lands; and suitable bridges, culverts or other works shall be constructed to\n\nprevent the drainage of the adjacent lands being obstructed by any canal.\n\nOn the completion of any canal or of any convenient section of any canal the Collector, after causing\nsuch inspection to be made as may be necessary, shall certify to the Government that suitable and\nsufficient means of crossing the canal, and suitable and sufficient means of drainage as aforesaid,\nhave been provided; or shall report in what respects the provision made for the above purposes is\ndefective; and if, at any time after he shall have given such certificate, it shall be brought to his notice\nthat the provision made as above has proved insufficient, the Collector shall cause inquiry to be made\ninto the circumstances of the case, and, if the statement is established, shall report his opinion thereon\nfor the consideration of the Government, and the Government shall cause such measures in reference\n\nthereto to be taken as it thinks proper.\n\n16/38\n\n30/08/2025\n\nGovernment may\nprohibit\nformation of\nobstructions\nwithin certain\nlimits\n\nCanal-officer may\nissue notice to\nperson causing\nobstructions\n\nCanal-officer may\ncause\nobstructions to\nbe removed\n\nWhen drainage\nworks necessary,\nGovernment may\norder scheme to\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-35.html\n\nThe Irrigation Act, 1876\n\nPART IV\nOF DRAINAGE\n\n40. Whenever it appears to the Government that injury to the public health or public convenience, or to\nany canal, or to any land for which irrigation from a canal is available, has arisen or may arise from the\nobstruction of any river, stream or natural drainage-course, the Government may, by notification\npublished in the official Gazette prohibit, within limits to be defined in such notification, the formation of\nany such obstruction, or may, within such limits, order the removal or other modification of such\n\nobstruction.\n\nThereupon so much of the said river, stream or natural drainage channel as is comprised within such\n\nlimits shall be held to be a drainage work as defined in section 3.\n\n41. The canal-officer or other person authorized by the Government in that behalf may, after such\npublication, issue and order to the person causing or having control over any such obstruction to\n\nremove or modify the same within a time to be fixed in the order.\n\n42. lf, within the time so fixed, such person does not comply with the order, the canal-officer may cause\nthe obstruction to be removed or modified; and if the person to whom the order was issued does not,\nwhen called upon, pay the expenses of such removal or modification, such expenses shall be\n\nrecoverable as a demand.\n\n43. Whenever it appears to the Government that any drainage works are necessary for the public\nhealth, or for the improvement or proper cultivation or irrigation of any lands in districts to which the\nprovisions of the §[* * *] Embankment and Drainage Act, 1952, do not, apply, or that protection from\n\nfloods or other accumulations of water, or from erosion by a river, is required for any lands,\n\n17/38\n\n30/08/2025\n\nbe drawn up and\ncarried out\n\nDisposal of\nclaims to\ncompensation\n\nLimitation of\nsuch claims\n\n\"Person\" defined\n\nRegister of\nvillage- channels\nto be kept\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-35.html\n\nThe Irrigation Act, 1876\n\nthe Government may cause a scheme for such works to be drawn up and carried into execution, and\nthe persons authorized by the Government to draw up and execute such scheme may exercise in\nconnection therewith all or any of the powers conferred on canal-officers by sections 33, 34 and 35,\n\nand shall be liable to any or all of the obligations imposed upon canal-officers by sections 36 and 37.\n\n44. Whenever, in pursuance of a notification made under section 40, any obstruction is removed or\nmodified;\n\nor whenever any drainage-work is carried out under the last preceding section,\n\nall claims for compensation on account of any loss consequent on the removal or modification of the\nsaid obstruction, or the construction of such work, may be made before the Collector, and he shall deal\n\nwith the same in the manner provided in Part Il; but no compensation shall be allowed for any damage\n\narising from increase of percolation.\n\n45. No such claim shall be entertained after the expiration of six months from the occurrence of the loss\ncomplained of, unless the Collector is satisfied that the claimant had sufficient cause for not making the\n\nclaim within such period.\n\nPART V\nOF VILLAGE-CHANNELS\n\n46. \"Person\" in this Part includes any number of persons acting jointly.\n\n47.

Any person desiring the construction of a new village-channel, but being unable or unwilling to\nconstruct it under a private arrangement with the owners and occupiers of the land affected, as\n\nmentioned in the last preceding section, may apply in writing to the canal-officer stating—\n\nthat he desires the said canal-officer, in his behalf and at his cost, to do all things necessary for\n\nconstructing such village-channel:\n\nthat he is ready to defray all costs necessary for acquiring the land and constructing such village-\n\nchannel.\n\n51. If the canal-officer considers the construction of such village-channel expedient, he may call upon\n\nthe applicant to deposit any part of the expense such officer may consider necessary,\n\nand, upon such deposit being made, shall cause inquiry to be made into the most suitable alignment for\n\nthe said village-channel,\n\nand shall mark out the land which, in his opinion, it will be necessary to occupy for the construction\n\nthereof,\n\nand shall forthwith publish a notification in every village through which the village-channel is proposed\n\nto be taken that so much of such land as is situated within such village has been so marked out,\n\nand shall send a copy of such notification to the Collector of every district in which any part of such land\n\nis known to be situate for publication on such land.\n\nSuch notification shall also call upon any person who wishes to be admitted a joint owner of such\nvillage- channel to make his application in that respect within thirty days of the publication of such\n\nnotification.\n\n20/38\n\n30/08/2025\n\nCollector to\nacquire land\n\nProcedure after\nconstruction of\nvillage-channel\n\nCanal-officer may\ndirect transfer of\nvillage-channel\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-35.html\n\nThe Irrigation Act, 1876\n\nIf any such applicant appears, and his application is admitted, he shall be liable to pay his share in the\nconstruction of such village-channel and the cost of acquiring such land, and shall be an owner of such\n\nvillage-channel constructed.\n\n52. On receipt of copy of such notification, the Collector shall proceed to acquire such land under the\nprovisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, as if a declaration had been issued by the Government for\nthe acquisition thereof under section 6 of that Act, and as if the Government had thereupon directed the\nCollector to take order for the acquisition of such land under section 7 of the said Act, and (if\nnecessary) as if the Government had issued orders for summary possession being taken under section\n\n17 of the said Act.\n\n53. On being put in possession of the land the canal-officer shall construct the required village-channel;\nand on its completion shall give to the applicant notice thereof, and of any sum payable by him on\n\naccount of the cost of acquiring the land and constructing the village-channel.\nOn such notice being given, such sum shall be due from the applicant to the canal-officer.\n\nOn receipt of payment in full of all expenses incurred, the canal-officer shall make over possession of\n\nsuch village-channel to such applicant.\n\n54.

When, through fraud or a mutual mistake of the parties, a contract or other instrument in writing\ndoes not truly express their intention, either party, or his representative in interest, may institute a suit\nto have the instrument rectified; and if the Court find it clearly proved that there has been fraud or\nmistake in framing the instrument, and ascertain the real intention of the parties in executing the same,\nthe Court may in its discretion rectify the instrument so as to express that intention, so far as this can\n\nbe done without prejudice to rights acquired by third persons in good faith and for value.\nIllustrations\n\n(a) A, intending to sell to B his house and one of three godowns adjacent to it, execute a conveyance\nprepared by B, in which, through B's fraud, all three godowns are included. Of the two godowns which\nwere fraudulently included, B gives one to C and lets the other to D for a rent, neither C nor D having\nany knowledge of the fraud.

For the purpose of rectifying a contract in writing, the Court must be satisfied that all the parties\n\nthereto intended to make an equitable and conscientious agreement.\n\n33. In rectifying a written instrument, the Court may inquire what the instrument was intended to mean,\nand what were intended to be its legal consequences, and is not confined to the inquiry what the\n\nlanguage of the instrument was intended to be.\n\n34. A contract in writing may be first rectified and then, if the plaintiff has so prayed in his plaint and the\n\nCourt thinks fit, specifically enforced.\n\nIllustration\n\nA contracts in writing to pay his attorney, B, a fixed sum in lieu of costs.

Any person interested in a contract in writing may sue to have it rescinded, and such rescission\n\nmay be adjudged by the Court in any of the following cases, namely:-\n\n(a) where the contract is viodable or terminable by the plaintiff;\n\n36/52\n\n30/08/2025\n\nRescission for\nmistake\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-36.html\n\nThe Specific Relief Act, 1877\n\n(b) where the contract is unlawful for causes not apparent on its face, and the defendant is more to\n\nblame than the plaintiff;\n\n(c) where a decree for specific performance of a contract of sale, or of a contract to take a lease, has\nbeen made, and the purchaser or lessee makes default in payment of the purchase-money or other\n\nsums which the Court has ordered him to pay.\n\nWhen the purchaser or lessee is in possession of the subject-matter, and the Court finds that such\npossession is wrongful, the Court may also order him to pay to the vendor or lessor the rents and\n\nprofits, if any, received by him as such possessor.\n\nIn the same case, the Court may, by order in the suit in which the decree has been made and not\ncomplied with, rescind the contract, either so far as regards the party in default, or altogether as the\n\njustice of the case may require.\nIllustrations\nto (a)-\n\nA sells a field to B.

A plaintiff instituting a suit for the specific performance of a contract in writing may pray in the\nalternative that, if the contract cannot be specifically enforced, it may be rescinded and delivered up to\nbe cancelled; and the Court, if it refuses to enforce the contract specifically, may direct it to be\n\nrescinded and delivered up accordingly.\n\n38. On adjudging the rescission of a contract, the Court may require the party to whom such relief is\n\ngranted to make any compensation to the other which justice may require.\n\nCHAPTER V\nOF THE CANCELLATION OF INSTRUMENTS\n\n39. Any person against whom a written instrument is void or voidable, who has reasonable\napprehension that such instrument, if left outstanding, may cause him serious injury, may sue to have it\nadjudged void or viodable; and the Court may, in its discretion, so adjudge it and order it to be delivered\n\nup and cancelled.\n\nIf the instrument has been registered under the °[Registration Act, 1908], the Court shall also send a\ncopy of its decree to the officer in whose office the instrument has been so registered; and such officer\n\nshall note on the copy of the instrument contained in his books the fact of its cancellation.\n\nIllustrations\n\n(a) A, the owner of a ship by fraudulently representing her to be seaworthy, induces B, an underwriter,\n\nto insure her.

The bills are drawn and accepted, but the\nship is not delivered according to the agreement. A sues B on one of the bills. B may obtain the\n\ncancellation of all the bills.\n\n40. Where an instrument is evidence of different rights or different obligations, the Court may, in a\n\nproper case, cancel it in part and allow it to stand for the residue.\nIllustration\n\nA draws a bill on B, who endorses it to C, by whom it appears to be endorsed to D, who endorses it to\nE.

Every person capable of binding himself or of being bound, by the making, drawing, acceptance or\nnegotiation of a negotiable instrument, may so bind himself or be bound by a duly authorised agent\n\nacting in his name.\n\nA general authority to transact business and to receive and discharge debts does not confer upon an\n\nagent the power of accepting or indorsing bills of exchange so as to bind his principal.\n\nAn authority to draw bills of exchange does not of itself import an authority to indorse.\n\n5[27A. A partner acting in the firm name may bind the firm by the making, drawing, acceptance or\nnegotiation of a negotiable instrument to the extent authorised by law relating to partnership for the\n\ntime being in force.]\n\n28.(1) Where a person signs a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque without adding to his\nsignature words indicating that he signs it as an agent for and on behalf of a principal or in a\nrepresentative character, he is personally liable thereon but the mere addition to his signature of words\ndescribing him as an agent or as filling a representative character does not exempt him from personal\nliability.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), any person signing a promissory note, bill of\nexchange or cheque for and on behalf of the principal is not liable to a person who induces him to sign\n\nupon the belief that the principal alone would be held liable.\n\n6[28A.(1) Where the holder of a negotiable instrument payable to bearer negotiates it by delivery\n\nwithout indorsing it, he is called a “transferor by delivery”.\n\n(2) A transferor by delivery is not liable on the instrument.\n\n12/60\n\n30/08/2025\n\nLiability of legal\nrepresentative\nsigning\n\nSignature\nessential to\nliability\n\nForged or\nunauthorised\nsignature\n\nStranger signing\ninstrument\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-46.html\n\nThe Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881\n\n(3) A transferor by delivery who negotiates a negotiable instrument thereby warrants to his immediate\ntransferee, being a holder for consideration, that the instrument is what it purports to be, that he has a\nright to transfer it, and that at the time of transfer he is not aware of any defect which renders it\n\nvalueless.]\n\n29. A legal representative of a deceased person who signs his name to a promissory note, bill of\nexchange or cheque is liable personally thereon unless he expressly limits his liability to the extent of\n\nthe assets received by him as such.\n\n29A. No person is liable as maker, drawer, indorser or acceptor of a promissory note, bill of exchange\n\nor cheque who has not signed it as such:\n\nProvided that where a person signs any such instrument in a trade or assumed name he is liable\n\nthereon as if he had signed it in his own name.\n\n29B. Subject to the provisions of this Act, where a signature on a promissory note, bill of exchange or\ncheque is forged or placed thereon without the authority of the person whose signature it purports to\nbe, the forged or unauthorised signature is wholly inoperative, and no right to retain the instrument or to\ngive a discharge therefor or to enforce payment thereof against any party thereto can be acquired\nthrough or under that signature, unless the party against whom it is sought to retain or enforce payment\n\nof the instrument is precluded from setting up the forgery or want of authority:\n\nProvided that nothing in this section shall effect the ratification of an unauthorised signature not\n\namounting to a forgery.\n\n13/60\n\n30/08/2025\n\npresumed to be\nindorser\n\nLiability of drawer\n\nLiability of\ndrawee of cheque\n\nLiability of maker\nof note and\nacceptor of bill\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-46.html\n\nThe Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881\n\n29C. A person placing his signature upon a negotiable instrument otherwise than as maker, drawer or\nacceptor is presumed to be an indorser unless he clearly indicates by appropriate words his intention to\n\nbe bound in some other capacity. ]\n\n30.(1) (a) The drawer of a bill of exchange by drawing it, engages that on due presentment it shall be\naccepted and paid according to its tenor, and that if it be dishonoured, he will compensate the holder or\n\nany indorser who is compelled to pay it; and\n\n(b) the drawer of a cheque by drawing it, engages that in the case of dishonour by the drawee he will\n\ncompensate the holder:\n\nProvided that due notice of dishonour of the bill or cheque has been given to or received by the drawer\n\nas hereinafter provided.\n\n(2) The drawee of a bill of exchange is not liable thereon until acceptance in the manner provided by\n\nthis Act.\n\n31. The drawee of a cheque having sufficient funds of the drawer in his hands properly applicable to\nthe payment of such cheque must pay the cheque when duly required so to do, and, in default of such\n\npayment, must compensate the drawer for any loss or damage caused by such default.\n\n32.(1) In the absence of a contract to the contrary, the maker of a promissory note, by making it, and\nthe acceptor before maturity of a bill of exchange by accepting it, engages that he will pay it according\nto the tenor of the note or his acceptance respectively, and in default of such payment, such maker or\nacceptor is bound to compensate any party to the note or bill or any loss or damage sustained by him\n\nand caused by such default.\n\n14/60\n\n30/08/2025\n\nOnly drawee can\nbe acceptor\nexcept in need or\nfor honour\n\nAcceptance by\nseveral drawees\nnot partners\n\nLiability of\nindorser\n\nLiability of prior\nparties to holder\nin due course\n\nMaker, drawer\nand accept or\nprincipals\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-46.html\n\nThe Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881\n\n(2) The acceptor of a bill of exchange at or after maturity, by accepting it, engages to pay the amount\n\nthereof to the holder on demand.\n\n33. No person except the drawee of a bill of exchange, or all or some of several drawees, or a person\nnamed therein as a drawee in case of need, or an acceptor for honour, can bind himself by an\n\nacceptance.\n\n34. Where there are several drawees of a bill of exchange who are not partners, each of them can\n\naccept it for himself, but none of them can accept it for another without his authority.\n\n35. In the absence of a contact to the contrary, the indorser of a negotiable instrument, by indorsing it,\nengages that on due presentment it shall be accepted and paid according to its tenor and that if it be\ndishonoured he will compensate the holder or subsequent indorser who is compelled to pay it for any\n\nloss or damage caused to him by such dishonour.\n\nEvery indorser after dishonour is liable as upon an instrument payable on demand.\n\n36. Every prior party to a negotiable instrument is liable thereon to a holder in due course until the\n\ninstrument is duly satisfied.\n\n37. The maker of a promissory note or cheque, the drawer of a bill of exchange until acceptance, and\nthe acceptor are, in the absence of a contract to the contrary, respectively liable thereon as principal\ndebtors, and the other parties thereto are liable thereon as sureties for the maker, drawer or acceptor,\n\nas the case may be.\n\n15/60\n\n30/08/2025\nPrior party a\nprincipal in\nrespect of each\nsubsequent party\n\nLiability of\naccommodation\nparty and\nposition of\naccommodation\n\nparty\n\nSuretyship\n\nDischarge of\nindorser’s liability\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-46.html\n\nThe Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881\n\n38.

As between E and C, C is the principal\n\ndebtor and D is his surety.\n\n7138A.(1) An accommodation party is liable on a negotiable instrument to a holder in due course,\nnotwithstanding that when such holder took the instrument he knew such party to be an\n\naccommodation party.\n\n(2) An accommodation party to a negotiable instrument, if he has paid the amount thereof, is entitled to\n\nrecover such amount from the party accommodated. ]\n\n39. When the holder of an accepted bill of exchange enters into any contract with the acceptor which,\nunder section 134 or 135 of the Contract Act, 1872, would discharge the other parties, the holder may\n\nexpressly reserve his right to charge the other parties, and in such case they are not discharged.\n\n40. When the holder of a negotiable instrument, without the consent of the indorser, destroys or impairs\nthe indorser's remedy against a prior party, the indorser is discharged from liability to the holder to the\n\nsame extent as if the instrument had been paid at maturity.\n\nIllustration\n\n16/60\n\nAcceptor bound\nalthough\nindorsement\nforged\n\nAcceptance of bill\ndrawn in fictitious\nname\n\nNegotiable\ninstrument made,\netc., without\nconsideration\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-46.html\n\nThe Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881\n\nA is the holder of a bill of exchange made payable to the order of B, which contains the following\n\nindorsements in blank:-\n\nFirst indorsement, “B”.\n\nSecond indorsement, “Peter Williams.”\nThird indorsement, “Wright & Co.”\nFourth indorsement, “John Rozario.”\n\nThis bill A puts in suit against John Rozario and strike out, without John Rozario's consent, the\nindorsements by Peter Williams, and Wright & Co. A is not entitled to recover anything from John\n\nRozario.\n\n41. An acceptor of a bill of exchange already indorsed is not relieved from liability by reason that such\nindorsement is forged, if he knew or had reason to believe the indorsement to be forged when he\n\naccepted the bill.\n\n42. An acceptor of a bill of exchange drawn in a fictitious name and payable to the drawer's order is\nnot, by reason that such name is fictitious, relieved from liability to any holder in due course claiming\nunder an indorsement by the same hand as the drawer's signature, and purporting to be made by the\n\ndrawer.\n\n43. A negotiable instrument made, drawn, accepted, indorsed or transferred without consideration, or\nfor a consideration which fails, creates no obligation of payment between the parties to the transaction.\n\nBut if any such party has transferred the instrument with or without indorsement to a holder for\n\n17/60\n\n30/08/2025\n\nPartial absence\nor failure of\nmoney-\nconsideration\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-46.html\n\nThe Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881\n\nconsideration, such holder, and every subsequent holder deriving title from him, may recover the\n\namount due on such instrument from the transferor for consideration or any prior party thereto.\n\nException | - No party for whose accommodation a negotiable instrument has been made, drawn,\naccepted or indorsed can, if he have paid the amount thereof, recover thereon such amount from any\n\nperson who became a party to such instrument for his accommodation.\n\nException II - No party to the instrument who has induced any other party to make, draw, accept,\nindorse or transfer the same to him for a consideration which he has failed to pay or perform in full shall\nrecover thereon an amount exceeding the value of the consideration (if any) which he has actually paid\n\nor performed.\n\n44. When the consideration for which a person signed a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque\nconsisted of money, and was originally absent in part or has subsequently failed in part, the sum which\na holder standing in immediate relation with such signer is entitled to receive from him is proportionally\n\nreduced.\n\nExplanation - The drawer of a bill of exchange stands in immediate relation with the acceptor. The\nmaker of a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque stands in immediate relation with the payee,\nand the indorser with his indorsee. Other signers may by agreement stand in immediate relation with a\n\nholder.\nIllustration\n\nA draws a bill on B for Taka 500 payable to the order of A.

Where a bill of exchange has been lost before it is overdue, the person who was the holder of it\nmay apply to the drawer to give him another bill of the same tenor, giving security to the drawer, if\nrequired, to indemnify him against all persons whatever in case the bill alleged to have been lost shall\n\nbe found again.\n\nIf the drawer on request as aforesaid refuses to give such duplicate bill, he may be compelled to do so.]\n\nPART IV\nOF NEGOTIATION\n\n46. The making, acceptance or indorsement of a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque is\n\ncompleted by delivery, actual or constructive.\n\nAs between parties standing in immediate relation, delivery to be effectual must be made by the party\n\nmaking, accepting or indorsing the instrument or by a person authorised by him in that behalf.\n\nAs between such parties and any holder of the instrument other than a holder in due course, it may be\nshown that the instrument was delivered conditionally or for a special purpose only, and not for the\n\npurpose of transferring absolutely the property therein.\n\nA promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque payable to bearer is negotiable by the delivery thereof.\n\n19/60\n\n30/08/2025\n\nNegotiation by\ndelivery\n\nNegotiation by\nindorsement\n\nConversion of\nindorsement in\nblank into\nindorsement in\nfull\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-46.html\n\nThe Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881\n\nA promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque payable to order is negotiable by the holder by\n\nindorsement and delivery thereof.\n\n47.

Subject to the provisions of section 58, a promissory note, bill if exchange or cheque payable to\n\norder is negotiable by the holder by indorsement and delivery thereof.\n\n49. When a negotiable instrument has been indorsed in blank, any holder may, without signing his own\nname, convert the blank indorsement into an indorsement in full by writing above the indorser's\nsignature a direction to pay the amount to or to the order of himself or some other person; and the\n\nholder does not thereby incur the responsibility of an indorser.\n\n20/60\n\n30/08/2025\n\nEffect of\nindorsement\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-46.html\n\nThe Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881\n\n50.(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act relating to restrictive, conditional and qualified indorsement,\nthe indorsement of a negotiable instrument followed by delivery transfers to the indorsee the property\n\ntherein with the right of further negotiation.\n(2) An indorsement is restrictive which either-\n(a) restricts or excludes the right to further negotiate the instrument; or\n\n(b) constitutes the indorsee an agent of the indorser to indorse the instrument or to receive its contents\n\nfor the indorser or for some other specified person:\n\nProvided that the mere absence of words implying right to negotiate does not make the indorsement\n\nrestrictive.\n\nIllustrations\n\nB signs the following indorsements on different negotiable instruments payable to bearer:-\n(a) \"Pay the contents to C only.\"\n\n(b) \"Pay C for my use.\"\n\n(c) “Pay C or order for the account of B.”\n\n(d) “The within must be credited to C.”\n\nThese indorsements exclude the right of further negotiation by C.\n(e) “Pay C.”\n\n(f) “Pay C value in account with the Oriental Bank.”\n\n21/60\n\n30/08/2025\n\nWho may\nnegotiate\n\nIndorser who\nexcludes his own\nliability or makes\nit conditional\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-46.html\n\nThe Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881\n\n(g) “Pay the contents to C, being part of the consideration in a certain deed of assignment executed by\n\nC to the indorser and others.”\n\nThese indorsements do not exclude the right of further negotiation by C.\n\n51.

In default of such presentment, the other parties thereto are not liable\n\nthereon to such holder.\nException - Where a promissory note is payable on demand and is not payable at a specified place, no\n\npresentment is necessary in order to charge the maker thereof nor is presentment necessary to charge\n\nthe acceptor of a bill of exchange.\n\nThe provisions of this section are without prejudice to the provisions relating to presentment or\n\nacceptance in the case of a bill of exchange.\n\nExplanation - Where there are several persons, not being partners liable on the negotiable instrument,\nas makers, acceptors or drawees, as the case may be, and no place of payment is specified,\n\npresentment must be made to them all.\n\n27/60\n\n30/08/2025\n\nPresentment for\npayment of\ninstrument\npayable after date\nor sight\n\nPresentment for\npayment of\npromissory note\npayable by\ninstalments\n\nPresentment for\npayment of\ninstrument\npayable at\nspecified place\nand not\nelsewhere\n\nInstrument\npayable at\nspecified place\n\nPresentment\nwhere no\nexclusive place\nspecified\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-46.html\n\nThe Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881\n\n65.

A Promissory note payable by instalments must be presented for payment on the third day after the\ndate fixed for payment of each instalment; and non-payment on such presentment has the same effect\n\nas non-payment of a note at maturity.\n\n68. A promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque made, drawn or accepted payable at a specified\nplace and not elsewhere must, in order to charge any party thereto, be presented for payment at that\n\nplace.\n\n69. A promissory note or bill of exchange made, drawn or accepted payable at a specified place must,\n\nin order to charge the maker or drawer thereof, be presented for payment at that place.\n\n70.

If the maker, drawee or acceptor of a negotiable instrument has no known place of business or\nresidence, and no place is specified in the instrument for presentment for acceptance or payment, such\n\npresentment may be made to him in person wherever he can be found.\n\nExplanation - In this section and sections 68 and 69, “specified place” means a place sufficiently\n\ndescribed so as to enable the person presenting the instrument to locate it.\n\n1171A.(1) To constitute a valid presentment it shall be sufficient if instead of the original negotiable\ninstrument a copy thereof certified to be true by the holder is delivered to the person liable thereon,\n\neither personally or by registered post or by other effective means.\n\n(2) If, after such delivery, the person liable to pay so demands, the holder shall allow him to inspect\nthe original negotiable instrument during the hours of business of the holder, and if the holder fails\n\nto do so within a reasonable time, the presentment shall be deemed to be invalid. ]\n\n72. Subject to the provisions of section 84, a cheque must, in order to charge the drawer, be presented\nat the bank upon which it is drawn before the relation between the drawer and his banker has been\n\naltered to the prejudice of the drawer.\n\n73.

Subject to the provisions of section 31, a negotiable instrument payable on demand must be\n\npresented for payment within a reasonable time after it is received by the holder.\n\n75. Presentment for acceptance or payment may be made to the duly authorised agent of the drawee,\nmaker or acceptor, as the case may be, or, where the drawee, maker or acceptor has died, to his legal\n\nrepresentative, or, where he has been declared an insolvent, to his assignee.\n\n127775A. Delay in presentment for acceptance or payment is excused if the delay is caused by\ncircumstances beyond the control of the holder, and not imputable to his default, misconduct or\nnegligence. When the cause of delay ceases to operate, presentment must be made within a\n\nreasonable time.]\n\n76. No presentment for payment is necessary, and the instrument shall be deemed to be dishonoured\n\nat the due date for presentment, in any of the following cases:-\n(a) if the maker, drawee or acceptor intentionally prevents the presentment of the instrument, or,\n\nif the instrument being payable at his place of business, he closes such place on a business day during\n\nthe usual business hours, or,\n\nif the instrument being payable at some other specified place, neither he nor any person authorised to\n\npay it attends at such place during the usual business hours, or\n\nif the instrument not being payable at any specified place, he cannot after due search be found;\n\n30/60\n\n30/08/2025\n\nLiability of banker\nfor negligently\ndealing with bill\npresented for\npayment\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-46.html\n\nThe Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881\n\n(b) as against any party sought to be charged therewith, if he has engaged to pay notwithstanding non-\n\npresentment;\n(c) as against any party if, after maturity, with knowledge that the instrument has not been presented-\n\nhe makes a part payment on account of the amount due on the instrument, or promises to pay the\namount due thereon in whole or in part,\nor otherwise waives his right to take advantage of any default in presentment for payment;\n\n(d) as against the drawer, if the drawer could not suffer damage from the want of such presentment;\n(e) where the drawee is a fictitious person;\n\n(f) as regards an indorser, where the negotiable instrument was made, drawn or accepted for the\naccommodation of that indorser and he had reason to expect that the instrument would not be paid if\n\npresented; and\n\n(g) where, after the exercise of reasonable diligence, presentment as required by this Act cannot be\n\neffected.\n\nExplanation - The fact that holder has reason to believe that the negotiable instrument will, on\n\npresentment, be dishonoured does not dispense with the necessity for presentment.\n\n77. When a bill of exchange accepted payable at a specified bank has been duly presented there for\npayment and dishonoured, if the banker so negligently or improperly keeps, deals with or delivers back\n\nsuch bill as to cause loss to the holder, he must compensate the holder for such loss.\n\nCHAPTER VI\nOF PAYMENT AND INTEREST\n\n31/60\n\n30/08/2025\n\nTo whom\npayment should\nbe made\n\nInterest when rate\nspecified or not\nspecified\n\nInterest when no\nrate specified\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-46.html\n\nThe Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881\n\n78.

Subject to the provisions of any law for the time being in force relating to the relief of debtors, and\n\nwithout prejudice to the provisions of section 34 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, —|\n\n(a) when interest at a specified rate is expressly made payable on a promissory note or bill of exchange\nand no date is fixed from which interest is to be paid, interest shall be calculated at the rate specified,\non the amount of the principal money due thereon, from the date of the note, or, in the case of a bill,\nfrom the date on which the amount becomes payable, until tender or realisation of such amount, or until\n\nthe date of the institution of a suit to recover such amount;\n\n(b) when a promissory note or bill of exchange is silent as regards interest or does not specify the rate\nof interest, interest on the amount of the principal money due thereon shall, notwithstanding any\ncollateral agreement relating to interest between any parties to the instrument, be allowed and\ncalculated at the rate of six per centum per annum from the date of the note, or, in the case of a bill,\nfrom the date on which the amount becomes payable, until tender or realisation of the amount due\n\nthereon, or until the date of the institution of a suit to recover such amount.\n\n80. When no rate of interest is specified in the instrument, interest on the amount due thereon shall,\nnot-withstanding any agreement relating to interest between any parties to the instrument, be\ncalculated at the rate of six per centum per annum from the date at which the same ought to have been\npaid by the party charged until tender or realisation of the amount due thereon, or until such date after\n\nthe institution of a suit to recover such amount as the Court directs.\n\n32/60\n\n30/08/2025\n\nDelivery of\ninstrument on\npayment, or\nindemnity in case\nof loss\n\nDischarge from\nliability-\n\n(a) by\ncancellation\n\n(b) by release\n\n(c) by payment\n\nDischarge by\nallowing drawee\nmore than forty-\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-46.html\n\nThe Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881\n\nExplanation - When the party charged is the indorser of an instrument dishonoured by non-payment, he\n\nis liable to pay interest only from the time that he receives notice of the dishonour.\n\n81. Any person liable to pay, and called upon by the holder thereof to pay, the amount due on a\npromissory note, bill of exchange or cheque is before payment entitled to have it shown, and is on\npayment entitled to have it delivered up, to him, or, if the instrument is lost or cannot be produced, to be\n\nindemnified against any further claim thereon against him.\n\nCHAPTER VII\nOF DISCHARGE FROM LIABILITY ON NOTES, BILLS AND CHEQUES\n\n82. The maker, acceptor or indorser respectively of a negotiable instrument is discharged from liability\n\nthereon-\n\n(a) to a holder thereof who cancels such acceptor's or indorser's name with intent to discharge him,\n\nand to all parties claiming under such holder;\n\n(b) to a holder thereof who otherwise discharges such maker, acceptor or indorser, and to all parties\n\nderiving title under such holder after notice of such discharge;\n\n(c) to all parties thereto, if the instrument is payable to bearer, or has been indorsed in blank, and such\n\nmaker, acceptor or indorser makes payment in due course of the amount due thereon.\n\n83. If the holder of a bill of exchange allows the drawee more than forty-eight hours, exclusive of public\nholidays, to consider whether he will accept the same, all previous parties not consenting to such\n\nallowance are thereby discharged from liability to such holder.\n\n33/60\n\n30/08/2025\n\neight hours to\naccept\n\nWhen cheque not\nduly presented\nand drawer\ndamaged thereby\n\nCheque payable\nto order\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-46.html\n\nThe Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881\n\n84.(1) Where a cheque is not presented for payment within a reasonable time of its issue, and the\ndrawer or person on whose account it is drawn had the right, at the time when presentment ought to\nhave been made, as between himself and the banker, to have the cheque paid and suffers actual\ndamage through the delay, he is discharged to the extent of such damage, that is to say, to the extent\nto which such drawer or person is a creditor of the banker to a larger amount than he would have been\n\nif such cheque had been paid.\n\n(2) In determining what is a reasonable time, regard shall be had to the nature of the instrument, the\n\nusage of trade and of bankers, and the facts of the particular case.\n\n(3) The holder of the cheque as to which such drawer or person is so discharged shall be a creditor, in\nlieu of such drawer or person, of such banker to the extent of such discharge and entitled to recover\n\nthe amount from him.\n\nIllustrations\n\n(a) A draws a cheque for Taka 1,000, and when the cheque ought to be presented, has funds at the\nbank to meet it. The bank fails before the cheque is presented.

Where any draft, that is, an order to pay money, drawn by one office of a bank upon\nanother office of the same bank for a sum of money payable to order on demand, purports to be\n\nindorsed by or on behalf of the payee, the bank is discharged by payment in due course. ]\n\n86. If the holder of a bill of exchange acquiesces in a qualified acceptance, or one limited to part of the\nsum mentioned in the bill, or which substitutes a different place or time for payment, or which, where\nthe drawees are not partners, is not signed by all the drawees, all previous parties whose consent is\nnot obtained to such acceptance are discharged as against the holder and those claiming under him,\n\nunless on notice given by the holder they assent to such acceptance.\nExplanation -An acceptance is qualified -\n\n(a) where it is conditional, declaring the payment to be dependent on the happening of an event therein\nstated;\n(b) where it undertakes the payment of part only of the sum ordered to be paid;\n\n(c) where, no place of payment being specified on the order it undertakes the payment at a specified\n\nplace, and not otherwise or elsewhere; or where, a place of payment being specified in the order, it\n\n35/60\n\n30/08/2025\n\nEffect of material\nalteration\n\nAlteration by\nindorsee\n\nAcceptor or\nindorser bound\nnotwithstanding\nprevious\nalteration\n\nPayment of\ninstrument on\nwhich alteration\nis not apparent\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-46.html\n\nThe Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881\n\nundertakes the payment at some other place and not otherwise or elsewhere;\n\n(d) where it undertakes the payment at a time other than that at which under the order it would be\n\nlegally due.\n\n87. Any material alteration of a negotiable instrument renders the same void as against any one who is\na party thereto at the time of making such alteration and does not consent thereto, unless it was made\n\nin order to carry out the common intention of the original parties;\n\nand any such alteration, if made by an indorsee, discharges his indorser from all liability to him in\n\nrespect of the consideration thereof.\n\nThe provisions of this section are subject to those of sections 20, 49, 86 and 125.\n\n88. An acceptor or indorser of a negotiable instrument is bound by his acceptance or indorsement\n\nnotwithstanding any previous alteration of the instrument.\n\n89. Where a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque has been materially altered but does not\n\nappear to have been so altered,\nor where a cheque is presented for payment which does not at the time of presentation appear to be\ncrossed or to have had a crossing which has been obliterated,\n\npayment thereof by a person or banker liable to pay, and paying the same according to the apparent\n\ntenor thereof at the time of payment and otherwise in due course, shall discharge such person or\n\n36/60\n\n30/08/2025\n\nExtinguishment\nof rights of action\non bill in\nacceptor’s hands\n\nDishonour by\nnon-acceptance\n\nDishonour by\nnon-payment\n\nBy and to whom\nnotice should be\ngiven\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-46.html\n\nThe Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881\n\nbanker from all liability thereon; and such payment shall not be questioned by reasoned of the\n\ninstrument having been altered or the cheque crossed.\n\n90.(1) The maker, drawer, acceptor or indorser of a negotiable instrument is discharged from liability\nthereon when the person liable thereon as principal debtor becomes the holder thereof at or after its\n\nmaturity.\n\n(2) When the holder of an accepted bill of exchange enters into any contract with the acceptor of the\nnature referred to in section 39, the other parties are discharged, unless the holder has expressly\n\nreserved his right to charge them.\n\nCHAPTER VIII\nOF NOTICE OF DISHONOUR\n\n91. A bill of exchange is said to be dishonoured by non-acceptance when the drawee, or one of several\ndrawees not being partners, makes default in acceptance upon being duly required to accept the bill, or\n\nwhere presentment is excused and the bill is not accepted.\n\nWhere the drawee is incompetent to contract, or the acceptance is qualified, the bill may be treated as\n\ndishonoured.\n\n92. A promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque is said to be dishonoured by non-payment when the\nmaker of the note, acceptor of the bill or drawee of the cheque makes default in payment upon being\n\nduly required to pay the same.\n\n93. When a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque is dishonoured by non-acceptance or non-\n\npayment, the holder thereof, or some party thereto who remains liable thereon, must give notice that\n\n37/60\n\n30/08/2025\n\nMode in which\nnotice may be\ngiven\n\nParty receiving\nmust transmit\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-46.html\n\nThe Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881\n\nthe instrument has been so dishonoured to all other parties whom the holder seeks to make severally\n\nliable thereon, and to some one of several parties whom he seeks to make jointly liable thereon.\n\nWhen a bill of exchange is dishonoured by non-acceptance the drawer or any indorser to whom such\nnotice is not given is discharged; but the rights of a holder in due course subsequent to the omission to\ngive notice shall not be prejudiced by that omission.\n\nWhen a bill of exchange is dishonoured by non-acceptance and due notice of dishonour is given, it\nshall not be necessary to give notice of a subsequent dishonour by non-payment, unless the bill shall,\n\nin the meantime, have been accepted.\n\nNothing in this section renders it necessary to give notice to the maker of the dishonoured promissory\n\nnote or the drawee or acceptor of the dishonoured bill of exchange or cheque.\n\n94. Notice of dishonour may be given to a duly authorised agent of the person to whom it is required to\nbe given, or, where he has died, to his legal representative, or, where he has been declared an\ninsolvent, to his assignee; may be oral or written; may, if written, be sent by post; and may be in any\nform; but it must inform the party to whom it is given, either in express terms or by reasonable\nintendment, that the instrument has been dishonoured, and in what way, and that he will be held liable\nthereon; and it must be given within a reasonable time after dishonour, at the place of business or (in\n\ncase such party has no place of business) at the residence of the party for whom it is intended.\n\nIf the notice is duly directed and sent by post and miscarries, such miscarriage does not render the\n\nnotice invalid.\n\n95. Any party receiving notice of dishonour must, in order to render any prior party liable to himself,\n\ngive notice of dishonour to such party within a reasonable time, unless such party otherwise receives\n\n38/60\n\n30/08/2025\n\nnotice of\ndishonour\n\nAgent for\npresentment\n\nWhen party to\nwhom notice\ngiven is dead\n\nWhen notice of\n\ndishonour is\nunnecessary\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-46.html\n\nThe Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881\n\ndue notice as provided by section 93.\n\n96. When the instrument is deposited with an agent for presentment, the agent entitled to the same\ntime to give notice to his principal as if he were the holder giving notice of dishonour, and the principal\n\nis entitled to a further like period to give notice of dishonour.\n\n97. When the party to whom notice of dishonour is despatched is dead, but the party despatching the\n\nnotice is ignorant of his death, the notice is sufficient.\n\n98. No notice of dishonour is necessary-\n\n(a) when it is dispensed with by the party entitled thereto;\n\n(b) in order to charge the drawer when he has countermanded payment;\n(c) when the party charged could not suffer damage for want of notice;\n\n(d) when the party entitled to notice cannot after due search be found; or the party bound to give notice\n\nis, for any other reason, unable without any fault of his own to give it;\n(e) to charge the drawers when the acceptor is also a drawer;\n(f) in the case of a promissory note which is not negotiable;\n\n(g) when the party entitled to notice, Knowing the facts, promises unconditionally to pay the amount due\n\non the instrument.\n\nCHAPTER IX\nOF NOTING AND PROTEST\n\n39/60\n\n30/08/2025\n\nNoting\n\nProtest\n\nProtest for better\nsecurity\n\nContents of\nprotest\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-46.html\n\nThe Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881\n\n99. When a promissory note or bill of exchange has been dishonoured by non-acceptance or non-\npayment, the holder may cause such dishonour to be noted by a notary public upon the instrument, or\n\nupon a paper attached thereto, or partly upon each.\n\nSuch note must be made within a reasonable time after dishonour, and must specify the date of\ndishonour, the reason, if any, assigned for such dishonour, or, if the instrument has not been expressly\n\ndishonoured, the reason why the holder treats it as dishonoured, and the notary's charges.\n\n100. When a promissory note or bill of exchange has been dishonoured by non-acceptance or non-\npayment, the holder may, within a reasonable time, cause such dishonour to be noted and certified by\n\na notary public. Such certificate is called a protest.\n\nWhen the acceptor of a bill of exchange has become insolvent, or his credit has been publicly\nimpeached, before the maturity of the bill, the holder may, within a reasonable time, cause a notary\npublic to demand better security of the acceptor, and on its being refused may, within a reasonable\ntime, cause such facts to be noted and certified as aforesaid. Such certificate is called a protest for\n\nbetter security.\n\n101. A protest under section 100 must contain-\n\n(a) either the instrument itself, or a literal transcript of the instrument and of everything written or printed\n\nthereupon;\n(b) the name of the person for whom and against whom the instrument has been protested;\n\n(c) a statement that payment or acceptance, or better security, as the case may be, has been\n\ndemanded of such person by the notary public; the terms of his answer, if any, or a statement that he\n\n40/60\n\n30/08/2025\n\nNotice of protest\n\nProtest for non-\npayment after\ndishonour by\nnon-acceptance\n\nProtest of foreign\nbills\n\nWhen noting\nequivalent to\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-46.html\n\nThe Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881\n\ngave no answer or that he could not be found;\n\n(d) when the note or bill has been dishonoured, the place and time of dishonour, and, when better\n\nsecurity has been refused, the place and time of refusal;\n(e) the subscription of the notary public making the protest;\n\n(f) in the event of an acceptance for honour or of a payment for honour, the name of the person by\nwhom, of the person for whom, and the manner in which, such acceptance or payment was offered and\n\neffected.\n\nA notary public may make the demand mentioned in clause (c) of this section either in person or by his\n\nclerk or, where authorised by agreement or usage, by registered letter.\n\n102. When a promissory note or bill of exchange is required by law to be protested, notice of such\nprotest must be given instead of notice of dishonour, in the same manner and subject to the same\n\nconditions; but the notice may be given by the notary public who makes the protest.\n\n103. All bills of exchange drawn payable at some other place than the place mentioned as the\nresidence of the drawee, and which are dishonoured by non-acceptance, may, without further\npresentment to the drawee, be protested for non-payment in the place specified for payment, unless\n\npaid before or at maturity.\n\n104. Foreign bills of exchange must be protested for dishonour when such protest is required by the\n\nlaw of the place where they are drawn.\n\n41/60\n\n30/08/2025\n\nprotest\n\nReasonable time\n\nReasonable time\nof giving notice\nof dishonour\n\nReasonable time\nfor transmitting\nsuch notice\n\nThe Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881\n\n151104A. For the purposes of this Act, where a bill or note is required to be protested within a\nspecified time or before some further proceeding is taken, it is sufficient that the bill has been noted\nfor protest before the expiration of the specified time or the taking of the proceeding; and the formal\n\nprotest may be extended at any time thereafter as of the date of the noting.]\n\nCHAPTER X\nOF REASONABLE TIME\n\n105. In determining what is a reasonable time for presentment for acceptance or payment, for giving\nnotice of dishonour and for noting, regard shall be had to the nature of the instrument and the usual\ncourse of dealing with respect to similar instruments, and, in calculating such time, public holidays shall\n\nbe excluded.\n\n106. If the holder and the party to whom notice of dishonour is given carry on business or live (as the\ncase may be) in different places, such notice is given within a reasonable time if it is despatched by the\n\nnext post or on the day next after the day of dishonour.\n\nIf the said parties carry on business or live in the same place, such notice is given within a reasonable\n\ntime if it is despatched in time to reach its destination on the day next after the day of dishonour.\n\n107. A party receiving notice of dishonour, who seeks to enforce his right against a prior party, transmits\nthe notice within a reasonable time if he transmits it within the same time after its receipt as he would\n\nhave had to give notice if he had been the holder.\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nOF ACCEPTANCE AND PAYMENT FOR HONOUR AND REFERENCE IN CASE OF NEED\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-46.html\n\n42/60\n\n30/08/2025\n\nAcceptance for\nhonour\n\nHow acceptance\nfor honour must\nbe made\n\nAcceptance not\nspecifying for\nwhose honour it\nis made\n\nLiability of\nacceptor for\nhonour\n\nWhen acceptor\nfor honour may\nbe charged\n\nPayment for\nhonour\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-46.html\n\nThe Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881\n\n108. When a bill of exchange has been noted or protested for non-acceptance or for better security,\nany person not being a party already liable thereon may, with the consent of the holder, by writing on\n\nthe bill, accept the same for the honour of any party thereto.\n\n109. A person desiring to accept for honour must, by writing on the bill under his hand, declare that he\naccepts under protest the protested bill for the honour of the drawer or of a particular indorser whom he\n\nnames, or generally for honour.\n\n110.

The defendant admits the obstruction, but\ndenies the right of way. The plaintiff proves that the right was peaceably and openly enjoyed by him,\nclaiming title thereto as an easement and as of right, without interruption, from 1st January, 1862, to 1st\nJanuary, 1882. The plaintiff is entitled to judgment.\n\n(b) In a like suit the plaintiff shows that the right was peaceably and openly enjoyed by him for twenty\nyears.

An easement may be acquired in virtue of a local custom. Such easements are called customary\n\neasements.\nIllustrations\n\n(a) By the custom of a certain village every cultivator of village land is entitled, as such, to graze his\ncattle on the common pasture. A, having become the tenant of a plot of uncultivated land in the village,\nbreaks up and cultivates that plot. He thereby acquires an easement to graze his cattle in accordance\nwith the custom.\n\n(b) By the custom of a certain town no owner or occupier of a house can open a new window therein so\nas substantially to invade his neighbour's privacy. A builds a house in the town near B's house. A\nthereupon acquires an easement that B shall not open new windows in his house so as to command a\nview of the portions of A's house which are ordinarily excluded from observation, and B acquires a like\n\neasement with respect to A's house.\n\n19.

Lying beyond Y, A has another farm Z,\nthe beneficial enjoyment of which is not necessary for the beneficial enjoyment of Y. He must not use\n\nthe easement for the purpose of passing to and from Z.\n\n(b) A, as owner of a certain house, has a right of way to and from it. For the purpose of passing to and\nfrom the house, the right may be used, not only by A, but by the members of his family, his guests,\nlodgers, servants, workmen, visitors and customers; for this is a purpose connected with the enjoyment\nof the dominant heritage. So, if A lets the house, he may use the right of way for the purpose of\n\ncollecting the rent and seeing that the house is kept in repair.\n\n22. The dominant owner must exercise his right in the mode which is least onerous to the servient\nowner; and, when the exercise of an easement can without detriment to the dominant owner be\nconfined to a determinate part of the servient heritage, such exercise shall, at the request of the\n\nservient owner, be so confined.\n\n16/37\n\n03/09/2025\n\nRight to alter\nmode of\nenjoyment\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-49.html\n\nThe Easements Act, 1882\n\nIllustrations\n\n(a) A has a right of way over B's field.

Subject to the provisions of section 22, the dominant owner may, from time to time, alter the mode\nand place of enjoying the easement, provided that he does not thereby impose any additional burden\non the servient heritage.\n\nException:- The dominant owner of a right of way cannot vary his line of passage at pleasure, even\nthough he does not thereby impose any additional burden on the servient heritage.\n\nIllustrations\n\n(a) A, the owner of a saw-mill, has a right to a flow of water sufficient to work the mill. He may convert\nthe saw-mill into a corn-mill, provided that it can be worked by the same amount of water.\n\n(b) A has a right to discharge on B's land the rain-water from the eaves of A's house. This does not\nentitle A to advance his eaves if, by so doing, he imposes a greater burden on B's land.\n\n(c) A, as the owner of a paper-mill, acquires a right to pollute a stream by pouring in the refuse-liquor\nproduced by making in the mill paper from rags. He may pollute the stream by pouring in similar liquor\nproduced by making in the mill paper by a new process from bamboos, provided that he does not\n\nsubstantially increase the amount, or injuriously change the nature, of the pollution.\n\n(d) A, a riparian owner, acquires, as against the lower riparian owners, a prescriptive right to pollute a\n\nstream by throwing sawdust into it.

The expenses incurred in constructing works, or making repairs, or doing any other act necessary\n\nfor the use or preservation of an easement, must be defrayed by the dominant owner.\n\n26. Where an easement is enjoyed by means of an artificial work, the dominant owner is liable to make\n\ncompensation for any damage to the servient heritage arising from the want of repair of such work.\n\n27. The servient owner is not bound to do anything for the benefit of the dominant heritage, and he is\nentitled, as against the dominant owner, to use the servient heritage in any way consistent with the\nenjoyment of the easement: but he must not do any act tending to restrict the easement or to render its\nexercise less convenient.\n\nIllustrations\n\n(a) A, as owner of a house, has a right to lead water and send sewage through B's land.

B must not\n\nplant trees so as to obstruct the passage to A's windows of that quantity of light.\n\n28. With respect to the extent of easements and the mode of their enjoyment, the following provisions\n\nshall take effect:-\n\nAn easement of necessity is co-extensive with the necessity as it existed when the easement was\n\nimposed.\n\nThe extent of any other easement and the mode of its enjoyment must be fixed with reference to the\n\nprobable intention of the parties and the purpose for which the right was imposed or acquired.\n\nIn the absence of evidence as to such intention and purpose-\n\n(a) a right of way of any one kind does not include a right of way of any other kind:\n\n(b) the extent of a right to the passage of light or air to a certain window, door or other opening,\nimposed by a testamentary or non-testamentary instrument, is the quantity of light or air that entered\n\nthe opening at the time the testator died or the non-testamentary instrument was made:\n\n20/37\n\n03/09/2025\n\nair\n\n(d) Prescriptive\nright to pollute air\nor water\n\n(e) Other\nprescriptive\nrights\n\nIncrease of\neasement\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-49.html\n\nThe Easements Act, 1882\n\n(c) the extent of a prescriptive right to the passage of light or air to a certain window, door or other\nopening is that quantity of light or air which has been accustomed to enter that opening during the\n\nwhole of the prescriptive period irrespectively of the purposes for which it has been used:\n\n(d) the extent of a prescriptive right to pollute air or water is the extent of the pollution at the\n\ncommencement of the period of user on completion of which the right arose: and\n\n(e) the extent of every other prescriptive right and the mode of its enjoyment must be determined by the\n\naccustomed user of the right.\n\n29. The dominant owner cannot, by merely altering or adding to the dominant heritage, substantially\nincrease an easement.\n\nWhere an easement has been granted or bequeathed so that its extent shall be proportionate to the\nextent of the dominant heritage, if the dominant heritage is increased by alluvion, the easement is\nproportionately increased, and, if the dominant heritage is diminished by diluvion, the easement is\npropor-tionately diminished.\n\nSave as aforesaid, no easement is affected by any change in the extent of the dominant or the servient\nheritage.\n\nIllustrations\n\n(a) A, the owner of a mill, has acquired a prescriptive right to divert to his mill part of the water of a\nstream. A alters the machinery of his mill. He cannot thereby increase his right to divert water.\n\n(b) Ahas acquired an easement to pollute a stream by carrying on a manufacture on its banks by which\n\na certain quantity of foul matter is discharged into it.

A buys a field and unites it to his farm. Ais not thereby entitled to\n\ntake leaves to manure this field.\n\n30. Where a dominant heritage is divided between two or more persons, the easement becomes\nannexed to each of the shares, but not so as to increase substantially the burden on the servient\nheritage: Provided that such annexation is consistent with the terms of the instrument, decree or\nrevenue-proceeding (if any) under which the division was made, and, in the case of prescriptive rights,\nwith the user during the prescriptive period.\n\nIllustrations\n\n(a) A house to which a right of way by a particular path is annexed is divided into two parts, one of\nwhich is granted to A, the other to B. Each is entitled, in respect of his part, to a right of way by the\nsame path.\n\n(b) A house to which is annexed the right of drawing water from a well to the extent of fifty buckets a\nday is divided into two distinct heritages, one of which is granted to A, the other to B.

B cannot obstruct the excessive user.\n\nCHAPTER IV\nTHE DISTURBANCE OF EASEMENTS\n\n32. The owner or occupier of the dominant heritage is entitled to enjoy the easement without\ndisturbance by any other person.\nIllustration\n\nA, as owner of a house, has a right of way over B's land. C, unlawfully enters on B's land, and obstructs\n\nAin his right of way. A may sue C for compensation, not for the entry, but for the obstruction.\n\n33. The owner of any interest in the dominant heritage, or the occupier of such heritage, may institute a\nsuit for compensation for the disturbance of the easement or of any right accessory thereto; provided\nthat the disturbance has actually caused substantial damage to the plaintiff.\n\nExplanation |.- The doing of any act likely to injure the plaintiff by affecting the evidence of the\neasement, or by materially diminishing the value of the dominant heritage, is substantial damage within\nthe meaning of this section and section 34.\n\nExplanation Il.- Where the easement disturbed is a right to the free passage of light passing to the\n\nopenings in a house, no damage is substantial within the meaning of this section unless it falls within\n\n23/37\n\n03/09/2025\n\nWhen cause of\naction arises for\nremoval of\nsupport\n\nInjunction to\n\nrestrain\ndisturbance\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-49.html\n\nThe Easements Act, 1882\n\nthe first Explanation, or interferes materially with the physical comfort of the plaintiff, or prevents him\nfrom carrying on his accustomed business in the dominant heritage as beneficially as he had done\nprevious to instituting the suit.\n\nExplanation IIl.- Where the easement disturbed is a right to the free passage of air to the openings in a\nhouse, damage is substantial within the meaning of this section if it interferes materially with the\nphysical comfort of the plaintiff, though it is not injurious to his health.\n\nIllustrations\n\n(a) A places a permanent obstruction in a path over which B, as tenant of C's house, has a right of way.\nThis is substantial damage to C, for it may affect the evidence of his reversionary right to the easement.\n(b) A, as owner of a house, has a right to walk along one side of B's house. B builds a verandah\noverhanging the way about ten feet from the ground, and so as not to occasion any inconvenience to\n\nfoot-passengers using the way. This is not substantial damage to A.\n\n34. The removal of the means of support to which a dominant owner is entitled does not give rise to a\n\nright to recover compensation unless and until substantial damage is actually sustained.\n\n35. Subject to the provisions of the Specific Relief Act, 1877, sections 52 to 57 (both inclusive), an\n\ninjunction may be granted to restrain the disturbance of an easement-\n\n(a) if the easement is actually disturoed-when compensation for such disturbance might be recovered\nunder this chapter:\n\n(b) if the disturbance is only threatened or intended-when the act threatened or intended must\n\nnecessarily, if performed, disturb the easement.\n\n24/37\n\n03/09/2025\n\nAbatement of\nobstruction of\neasement\n\nExtinction by\ndissolution of\nright of servient\nowner\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-49.html\n\nThe Easements Act, 1882\n\n36. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 24, the dominant owner cannot himself abate a wrongful\n\nobstruction of an easement.\n\nCHAPTER V\nTHE EXTINCTION, SUSPENSION AND REVIVAL OF EASEMENTS\n\n37. When, from a cause which preceded the imposition of an easement, the person by whom it was\n\nimposed ceases to have any right in the servient heritage, the easement is extinguished.\n\nException.-Nothing in this section applies to an easement lawfully imposed by a mortgagor in\n\naccordance with section 10.\nIllustrations\n\n(a) A transfers Ulipur to B on condition that he does not marry C. B imposes an easement on Ulipur.\n\nThen B marries C. B's interest in Ulipur ends, and with it the easement is extinguished.\n\n(b) A, in 1860, let Ulipur to B for thirty years from the date of the lease. B, in 1861, imposes an\neasement on the land in favour of C, who enjoys the easement peaceably and openly as an easement\nwithout interruption for twenty-nine years. B's interest in Ulipur then ends, and with it C's easement.\n\n(c) Aand B, tenants of C, have permanent transferable interests in their respective holdings. A imposes\non his holding an easement to draw water from a tank for the purpose of irrigating B's land. B enjoys\nthe easement for twenty years. Then A's rent falls into arrear and his interest is sold. B's easement is\nextinguished.\n\n(d) A mortgages Ulipur to B, and lawfully imposes an easement on the land in favour of C in\naccordance with the provisions of section 10. The land is sold to D in satisfaction of the mortgage-debt.\n\nThe easement is not thereby extinguished.\n\n25/37\n\n03/09/2025\n\nExtinction by\nrelease\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-49.html\n\nThe Easements Act, 1882\n\n38. An easement is extinguished when the dominant owner releases it, expressly or impliedly, to the\n\nservient owner.\n\nSuch release can be made only in the circumstances and to the extent in and to which the dominant\n\nowner can alienate the dominant heritage.\n\nAn easement may be released as to part only of the servient heritage.\n\nExplanation I.-An easement is impliedly released-\n\n(a) where the dominant owner expressly authorises an act of a permanent nature to be done on the\nservient heritage, the necessary consequence of which is to prevent his future enjoyment of the\neasement, and such act is done in pursuance of such authority;\n\n(b) where any permanent alteration is made in the dominant heritage of such a nature as to show that\nthe dominant owner intended to cease to enjoy the easement in future.\n\nExplanation Il.- Mere non-user of an easement is not an implied release within the meaning of this\nsection.\n\nIllustrations\n\n(a) A, B and C are co-owners of a house to which an easement is annexed. A, without the consent of B\nand C, releases the easement. This release is effectual only as against A and his legal representative.\n(b) A grants B and easement over A's land for the beneficial enjoyment of his house. B assigns the\nhouse to C. B then purports to release the easement.

An easement is extinguished where it has been imposed for a limited period, or acquired on\ncondition that it shall become void on the performance or non-performance of a specified act, and the\n\nperiod expires or the condition is fulfilled.\n\n41. An easement of necessity is extinguished when the necessity comes to an end.\nIllustration\n\nA grants B a field inaccessible except by passing over A's adjoining land.

Where, by any permanent change in the dominant heritage, the burden on the servient heritage is\nmaterially increased and cannot be reduced by the servient owner without interfering with the lawful\n\nenjoyment of the easement, the easement is extinguished, unless-\n\n(a) it was intended for the beneficial enjoyment of the dominant heritage, to whatever extent the\neasement should be used; or\n\n(b) the injury caused to the servient owner by the change is so slight that no reasonable person would\ncomplain of it; or\n\n(c) the easement is an easement of necessity.\n\nNothing in this section shall be deemed to apply to an easement entitling the dominant owner to\n\nsupport of the dominant heritage.\n\n44.

An easement is suspended when the dominant owner becomes entitled to possession of the\nservient heritage for a limited interest therein, or when the servient owner becomes entitled to\n\npossession of the dominant heritage for a limited interest therein.\n\n50.

It is proved that A gave B a month's notice of his\nintention to abandon the easement, and that such notice was sufficient to enable B, without\n\nunreasonable expense, to have prevented the damage. The suit must be dismissed.\n\n51. An easement extinguished under section 45 revives (a) when the destroyed heritage is, before\ntwenty years have expired, restored by the deposit of alluvion; (b) when the destroyed heritage is a\nservient building and before twenty years have expired such building is rebuilt upon the same site; and\n(c) when the destroyed heritage is a dominant building and before twenty years have expired such\nbuilding is rebuilt upon the same site and in such a manner as not to impose a greater burden on the\n\nservient heritage.\n\nAn easement extinguished under section 46 revives when the grant or bequest by which the unity of\n\nownership was produced is set aside by the decree of a competent Court.

Where one person grants to another, or to a definite number of other persons, a right to do, or\ncontinue to do, in or upon the immoveable property of the grantor, something which would, in the\nabsence of such right, be unlawful, and such right does not amount to an easement or an interest in the\n\nproperty, the right is called a license.\n\n53. A license may be granted by any one in the circumstances and to the extent in and to which he may\n\ntransfer his interests in the property affected by the license.\n\n54. The grant of a license may be express or implied from the conduct of the grantor, and an\nagreement which purports to create an easement, but is ineffectual for that purpose, may operate to\n\ncreate a license.\n\n33/37\n\n03/09/2025\n\nby law\n\nLicense when\ntransferable\n\nGrantor’s duty to\ndisclose defects\n\nGrantor’s duty\nnot to render\nproperty unsafe\n\nGrantor’s\ntransferee not\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-49.html\n\nThe Easements Act, 1882\n\n55.

In\nthe absence of express provision to the contrary, B's servants may enter on the land for the purpose of\n\nerecting sheds, erect the same, deposit grain therein and remove grain therefrom.\n\n57. The grantor of a license is bound to disclose to the licensee any defect in the property affected by\nthe license, likely to be dangerous to the person or property of the licensee, of which the grantor is, and\n\nthe licensee is not, aware.\n\n58. The grantor of a license is bound not to do anything likely to render the property affected by the\n\nlicense dangerous to the person or property of the licensee.\n\n59.

In the following sections “transfer of property” means an act by which a living person conveys\nproperty, in present or in future, to one or more other living persons, or to himself, or to himself and one\nor more other living persons; and “to transfer property” is to perform such act.In this section “living\n\n4/81\n\n03/09/2025\n\nWhat may be\ntransferred\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-48.html\n\nThe Transfer of Property Act, 1882\n\nperson” includes a company or associations or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not, but\nnothing herein contained shall affect any law for the time being in force relating to transfer of property\n\nto or by companies, associations or bodies of individuals.\n\n6. Property of any kind may be transferred, except as otherwise provided by this Act or by any other\n\nlaw for the time being in force.\n\n(a) The chance of an heir-apparent succeeding to an estate, the chance of a relation obtaining a legacy\n\non the death of a kinsman, or any other mere possibility of a like nature, cannot be transferred.\n\n(b) A mere right of re-entry for breach of a condition subsequent cannot be transferred to any one\n\nexcept the owner of the property affected thereby.\n\n(c) An easement cannot be transferred apart from the dominant heritage.\n\n(d) An interest in property restricted in its enjoyment to the owner personally cannot be transferred by\nhim.\n\n(dd) A right to future maintenance, in whatsoever manner arising, secured or determined, cannot be\ntransferred.\n\n(e) Amere right to sue cannot be transferred.\n\n(f) A public office cannot be transferred, nor can the salary of a public officer, whether before or after it\nhas become payable.\n\n(g) Stipends allowed to military, naval, air-force and civil pensioners of the Government and political\npensions cannot be transferred.\n\n(h) No transfer can be made (1) in so far as it is opposed to the nature of the interest affected thereby,\n\nor (2) for an unlawful object or consideration within the meaning of section 23 of the Contract Act, 1872,\n\n5/81\n\n03/09/2025\n\nPersons\ncompetent to\ntransfer\n\nOperation of\ntransfer\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-48.html\n\nThe Transfer of Property Act, 1882\n\nor (3) to a person legally disqualified to be transferee.\n\n(i) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to authorise a tenant having an untrasnferable right of\noccupancy, the farmer of an estate in respect of which default has been made in paying revenue or the\nlessee of an estate under the management of a Court of Wards, to assign his interest as such tenant,\n\nfarmer or lessee.\n\n7. Every person competent to contract and entitled to transferable property, or authorised to dispose of\ntransferable property not his own, is competent to transfer such property either wholly or in part, and\neither absolutely or conditionally, in the circumstances, to the extent and in the manner allowed and\n\nprescribed by any law for the time being in force.\n\n8. Unless a different intention is expressed or necessarily implied, a transfer of property passes\nforthwith to the transferee all the interest which the transferor is then capable of passing in the property,\nand in the legal incidents thereof.\n\nSuch incidents include, where the property is land, the easements annexed thereto, the rents and\nprofits thereof accruing after the transfer, and all things attached to the earth;\n\nand, where the property is machinery attached to the earth, the moveable parts thereof;\n\nand, where the property is a house, the easements annexed thereto, the rent thereof accruing after the\ntransfer, and the locks, keys, bars, doors, windows, and all other things provided for permanent use\ntherewith;\n\nand, where the property is a debt or other actionable claim, the securities therefor (except where they\nare also for other debts or claims not transferred to the transferee), but not arrears of interest accrued\n\nbefore the transfer;\n\n6/81\n\n03/09/2025\n\nOral transfer\n\nCondition\nrestraining\nalienation\n\nRestriction\nrepugnant to\ninterest created\n\nCondition making\ninterest\ndeterminable on\ninsolvency or\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-48.html\n\nThe Transfer of Property Act, 1882\n\nand, where the property is money or other property yielding income, the interest or income thereof\n\naccruing after the transfer takes effect.\n\n9. A transfer of property may be made without writing in every case in which a writing is not expressly\n\nrequired by law.\n\n10. Where property is transferred subject to a condition or limitation absolutely restraining the\ntransferee or any person claiming under him from parting with or disposing of his interest in the\nproperty, the condition or limitation is void, except in the case of a lease where the condition is for the\nbenefit of the lessor or those claiming under him : Provided that property may be transferred to or for\nthe benefit of a woman (not being a Hindu, ‘[Muslim] or Buddhist), so that she shall not have power\n\nduring her marriage to transfer or charge the same or her beneficial interest therein.\n\n11. Where, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is created absolutely in favour of any person,\nbut the terms of the transfer direct that such interest shall be applied or enjoyed by him in a particular\n\nmanner, he shall be entitled to receive and dispose of such interest as if there were no such direction.\n\nWhere any such direction has been made in respect of one piece of immoveable property for the\npurpose of securing the beneficial enjoyment of another piece of such property, nothing in this section\nshall be deemed to affect any right which the transferor may have to enforce such direction or any\n\nremedy which he may have in respect of a breach thereof.\n\n12.

Where, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is created in favour of a person without\nspecifying the time when it is to take effect, or in terms specifying that it is to take effect forthwith or on\nthe happening of an event which must happen, such interest is vested, unless a contrary intention\n\nappears from the terms of the transfer.\nA vested interest is not defeated by the death of the transferee before he obtains possession.\n\nExplanation.-An intention that an interest shall not be vested is not to be inferred merely from a\nprovision whereby the enjoyment thereof is postponed, or whereby a prior interest in the same property\nis given or reserved to some other person, or whereby income arising from the property is directed to\nbe accumulated until the time of enjoyment arrives, or from a provision that if a particular event shall\n\nhappen the interest shall pass to another person.\n\n20. Where, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is created for the benefit of a person not then\nliving, he acquires upon his birth, unless a contrary intention appear from the terms of the transfer, a\n\nvested interest, although he may not be entitled to the enjoyment thereof immediately on his birth.\n\n21. Where, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is created in favour of a person to take effect\nonly on the happening of a specified uncertain event, or if a specified uncertain event shall not happen,\nsuch person thereby acquires a contingent interest in the property.

Where, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is created in favour of such members only of a\nclass as shall attain a particular age, such interest does not vest in any member of the class who has\n\nnot attained that age.\n\n23. Where, on transfer of property, an interest therein is to accrue to a specified person if a specified\nuncertain event shall happen, and no time is mentioned for the occurrence of that event, the interest\nfalls unless such event happens before, or at the same time as, the intermediate or precedent interest\n\nceases to exist.\n\n24. Where, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is to accrue to such of certain persons as shall\nbe surviving at some period, but the exact period is not specified, the interest shall go to such of them\nas shall be alive when the intermediate or precedent interest ceases to exist, unless a contrary\n\nintention appears from the terms of the transfer.\nIllustration\n\nA transfers property to B for life, and after his death to C and D, equally to be divided between them, or\n\nto the survivor of them.

Where, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is created in favour of one person, and by the\nsame transaction an ulterior disposition of the same interest is made in favour of another, if the prior\ndisposition under the transfer shall fail, the ulterior disposition shall take effect upon the failure of the\nprior disposition, although the failure may not have occurred in the manner contemplated by the\n\ntransferor.\n\n12/81\n\n03/09/2025\n\nUlterior transfer\nconditional on\nhappening or not\nhappening of\nspecified event\n\nFulfilment of\ncondition\nsubsequent\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-48.html\n\nThe Transfer of Property Act, 1882\n\nBut, where the intention of the parties to the transaction is that the ulterior disposition shall take effect\nonly in the event of the prior disposition failing in a particular manner, the ulterior disposition shall not\ntake effect unless the prior disposition fails in that manner.\n\nIllustrations\n\n(a) A transfers Tk. 500 to B on condition that he shall execute a certain lease within three months after\nA's death, and, if he should neglect to do so, to C.

On a transfer of property an interest therein may be created to accrue to any person with the\ncondition superadded that in case a specified uncertain event shall happen such interest shall pass to\nanother person, or that in case a specified uncertain event shall not happen such interest shall pass to\nanother person. In each case the dispositions are subject to the rules contained in sections 10, 12, 21,\n\n22, 23, 24, 25 and 27.\n\n29.

B is entitled to the farm\n\nduring her life as if no condition had been inserted.\n\n31. Subject to the provisions of section 12, on a transfer of property an interest therein may be created\nwith the condition superadded that it shall cease to exist in case a specified uncertain event shall\n\nhappen, or in case a specified uncertain event shall not happen.\nIllustrations\n\n(a) A transfers a farm to B for his life, with a proviso that, in case B cuts down a certain wood, the\n\ntransfer shall cease to have any effect.

In order that a condition that an interest shall cease to exist may be valid, it is necessary that the\nevent to which it relates be one which could legally constitute the condition of the creation of an\n\ninterest.\n\n33. Where, on a transfer of property, an interest therein is created subject to a condition that the person\ntaking it shall perform a certain act, but no time is specified for the performance of the act, the condition\nis broken when he renders impossible, permanently or for an indefinite period, the performance of the\n\nact.\n\n14/81\n\n03/09/2025\n\nTransfer\nconditional on\nperformance of\nact, time being\nspecified\n\nElection when\nnecessary\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-48.html\n\nThe Transfer of Property Act, 1882\n\n34. Where an act is to be performed by a person either as a condition to be fulfilled before an interest\ncreated on a transfer of property is enjoyed by him, or as a condition on the non-fulfilment of which the\ninterest is to pass from him to another person, and a time is specified for the performance of the act, if\nsuch performance within the specified time is prevented by the fraud of a person who would be directly\nbenefited by non-fulfilment of the condition, such further time shall as against him be allowed for\nperforming the act as shall be requisite to\n\nmake up for the delay caused by such fraud. But if no time is specified for the performance of the act,\nthen, if its performance is by the fraud of a person interested in the non-fulfilment of the condition\nrendered impossible or indefinitely postponed, the condition shall as against him be deemed to have\n\nbeen fulfilled.\n\nElection\n\n35. Where a person professes to transfer property which he has no right to transfer, and as part of the\nsame transaction confers any benefit on the owner of the property, such owner must elect either to\nconfirm such transfer or to dissent from it; and in the latter case he shall relinquish the benefit so\nconferred, and the benefit so relinquished shall revert to the transferor or his representative as if it had\n\nnot been disposed of,\nsubject nevertheless,\n\nwhere the transfer is gratuitous, and the transferor has, before the election, died or otherwise become\n\nincapable of making a fresh transfer,\n\nand in all cases where the transfer is for consideration,\n\n15/81\n\n03/09/2025\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-48.html\n\nThe Transfer of Property Act, 1882\n\nto the charge of making good to the disappointed transferee the amount or value of the property\nattempted to be transferred to him.\n\nIllustrations\n\nThe farm of Ulipur is the property of C and worth Tk. 800.

The surrender, express or implied, of a lease of immoveable property does not prejudice an under\n-lease of the property or any part thereof previously granted by the lessee, on terms and conditions\nsubstantially the same (except as regards the amount of rent) as those of the original lease; but, unless\nthe surrender is made for the purpose of obtaining a new lease, the rent payable by, and the contracts\nbinding on, the under-lessee shall be respectively payable to and enforceable by the lessor.\n\nThe forfeiture of such a lease annuls all such under -leases except where such forfeiture has been\nprocured by the lessor in fraud of the under-lessees, or relief against the forfeiture is granted under\n\nsection 114.\n\n116. If a lessee or under-lessee of property remains in possession thereof after the determination of the\nlease granted to the lessee, and the lessor or his legal representative accepts rent from the lessee or\nunder-lessee, or otherwise assents to his continuing in possession, the lease is, in the absence of an\nagreement to the contrary, renewed from year to year, or from month to month, according to the\npurpose for which the property is leased, as specified in section 106.\n\nIllustrations\n\n(a) A lets a house to B for five years.

None of the provisions of this Chapter apply to leases for agricultural purposes, except in so far as\nthe Government may, by notification published in the official Gazette, declare all or any of such\nprovisions to be so applicable in the case of all or any of such leases, together with, or subject to, those\n\nof the local law, if any, for the time being in force.\n\nSuch notification shall not take effect until the expiry of six months from the date of its publication.\n\nCHAPTER VI\nOF EXCHANGES\n\n118. When two persons mutually transfer the ownership of one thing for the ownership of another,\n\nneither thing or both things being money only, the transaction is called an “exchange”.\n\nA transfer of property in completion of an exchange can be made only in manner provided of the\n\ntransfer of such property by sale.\n\n119. If any party to an exchange or any person claiming through or under such party is by reason of\nany defect in the title of the other party deprived of the thing or any part of the thing received by him in\nexchange, then, unless a contrary intention appears from the terms of the exchange, such other party\nis liable to him or any person claiming through or under him for loss caused thereby, or at the option of\nthe person so deprived, for the return of the thing transferred, if still in the possession of such other\n\nparty or his legal representative or a transferee from him without consideration.\n\n71/81\n\n03/09/2025\n\nparties\n\nExchange of\nmoney\n\n“Gift” defined\n\nAcceptance when\nto be made\n\nTransfer how\neffected\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-48.html\n\nThe Transfer of Property Act, 1882\n\n120. Save as otherwise provided in this Chapter, each party has the rights and is subject to the\nliabilities of a seller as to that which he gives, and has the rights and is subject to the liabilities of a\n\nbuyer as to that which he takes.\n\n121. On an exchange of money, each party thereby warrants the genuineness of the money given by\n\nhim.\n\nCHAPTER VII\nOF GIFTS\n\n122. “Gift” is the transfer of certain existing moveable or immoveable property made voluntarily and\nwithout consideration, by one person, called the donor, to another, called the donee, and accepted by\n\nor on behalf of the donee.\n\nSuch acceptance must be made during the lifetime of the donor and while he is still capable of giving.\n\nIf the donee dies before acceptance, the gift is void.\n\n123. For the purpose of making a gift of immoveable property, the transfer must be effected by a\n\nregistered instrument signed by or on behalf of the donor, and attested by at least two witnesses.\n\n327Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, a heba under\n\nMuhammadan law shall be deemed to be a gift of immoveable property for the aforesaid purpose.]\n\nFor the purpose of making a gift of moveable property, the transfer may be effected either by a\n\nregistered instrument signed as aforesaid or by delivery.\n\nSuch delivery may be made in the same way as goods sold may be delivered\n\n72/81\n\n03/09/2025\n\nGift of existing\nand future\nproperty\n\nGift to several of\nwhom one does\nnot accept\n\nWhen gift may be\nsuspended or\nrevoked\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-48.html\n\nThe Transfer of Property Act, 1882\n\n124. A gift comprising both existing and future property is void as to the latter.\n\n125. A gift of a thing to two or more donees, of whom one does not accept it, is void as to the interest\n\nwhich he would have taken had he accepted.\n\n126. The donor and donee may agree that on the happening of any specified event which does not\ndepend on the will of the donor a gift shall be suspended or revoked; but a gift which the parties agree\nshall be revocable wholly or in part, at the mere will of the donor, is void wholly or in part, as the case\nmay be.\n\nA gift may also be revoked in any of the cases (save want or failure of consideration) in which, if it were\na contract, it might be rescinded.\n\nSave as aforesaid, a gift cannot be revoked.\n\nNothing contained in this section shall be deemed to affect the rights of transferees for consideration\nwithout notice.\n\nIllustrations\n\n(a) A gives a field to B, reserving to himself, with B's assent, the right to take back the field in case B\nand his descendants die before A. B dies without descendants in A's lifetime. A may take back the field.\n(b) A gives a lakh of Tk. to B, reserving to himself, with B's assent, the right to take back at pleasure Tk.\n10,000, out of the lakh. The gift holds goods as to Tk. 90,000, but is void as to Tk. 10,000, which\n\ncontinue to belong to A.\n\n73/81\n\n03/09/2025\n\nOnerous gifts.\nOnerous gift to\ndisqualified\nperson.\n\nOnerous gift to\ndisqualified\nperson\n\nUniversal donee\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-48.html\n\nThe Transfer of Property Act, 1882\n\n127. Where a gift is in the form of a single transfer to the same person of several things of which one is,\nand the others are not, burden by an obligation, the donee can take nothing by the gift unless he\naccepts it fully.\n\nWhere a gift is in the form of two or more separate and independent transfers to the same person of\nseveral things, the donee is at liberty to accept one of them and refuse the others, although the former\n\nmay be beneficial and the latter onerous.\n\nA donee not competent to contract and accepting property burdened by any obligation is not bound by\nhis acceptance. But if, after becoming competent to contract and being aware of the obligation, he\nretains the property given, he becomes so bound.\n\nIllustrations\n\n(a) Ahas shares in X, a prosperous joint stock company, and also shares in Y, a joint stock company, in\ndifficulties.

A “trust” is an obligation annexed to the ownership of property, and arising out of a confidence\nreposed in and accepted by the owner, or declared and accepted by him, for the benefit of another, or\nof another and the owner: the person who reposes or declares the confidence is called the “author of\nthe trust”: the person who accepts the confidence is called the “trustee”: the person for whose benefit\nthe confidence is accepted is called the “beneficiary”: the subject-matter of the trust is called “trust-\nproperty” or “trust-money”: the “beneficial interest” or “interest” of the beneficiary is his right against the\ntrustee as owner of the trust-property; and the instrument, if any, by which the trust is declared is called\n\nthe “instrument of trust”:\n\na breach of any duty imposed on a trustee, as such, by any law for the time being in force, is called a\n\n“preach of trust”:\n\nAnd in this Act, unless there be something repugnant in the subject or context, “registered” means\nregistered under the law for the registration of documents for the time being in force: a person is said to\nhave “notice” of a fact either when he actually knows that fact, or when, but for wilful abstention from\ninquiry or gross negligence, he would have known it, or when information of the fact is given to or\nobtained by his agent, under the circumstances mentioned in the Contract Act, 1872, section 229; and\nall expressions used herein and defined in the Contract Act, 1872, shall be deemed to have the\n\nmeanings respectively attributed to them by that Act.\n\nCHAPTER II\nOF THE CREATION OF TRUSTS\n\n4. A trust may be created for any lawful purpose. The purpose of a trust is lawful unless it is (a)\n\nforbidden by law, or (b) is of such a nature that, if permitted, it would defeat the provisions of any law, or\n\n2/46\n\n30/08/2025\n\nTrust of\nimmoveable\nproperty\n\nTrust of moveable\nproperty\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-47.html\n\nThe Trusts Act, 1882\n\n(c) is fraudulent, or (d) involves or implies injury to the person or property of another, or (e) the Court\n\nregards it as immoral or opposed to public policy.\n\nEvery trust of which the purpose is unlawful is void. And where a trust is created for two purposes, of\nwhich one is lawful and the other unlawful, and the two purposes cannot be separated, the whole trust\nis void.\n\nExplanation - In this section the expression “law” includes, where the trust-property is immoveable and\n\nsituate in a foreign country, the law of such country.\nIllustrations\n\n(a) A conveys property to B in trust to apply the profits to the nurture of female foundings to be trained\n\nup as prostitutes. The trust is void.\n\n(b) A bequeaths property to B in trust to employ it in carrying on a smuggling business, and out of the\n\nprofits thereof to support A's children. The trust is void.\n\n(c) A, while in insolvent circumstances, transfers property to B in trust for A during his life, and after his\n\ndeath for B. Ais declared an insolvent. The trust for A is invalid as against his creditors.\n\n5. No trust in relation to immoveable property is valid unless declared by a non-testamentary\ninstrument in writing signed by the author of the trust or the trustee and registered, or by the will of the\n\nauthor of the trust or of the trustee.\n\nNo trust in relation to moveable property is valid unless declared as aforesaid, or unless the ownership\n\nof the property is transferred to the trustee.\n\nThese rules do not apply where they would operate so as to effectuate a fraud.\n\n3/46\n\n30/08/2025\n\nCreation of trust\n\nWho may create\ntrusts\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-47.html\n\nThe Trusts Act, 1882\n\n6. Subject to the provisions of section 5, a trust is created when the author of the trust indicates with\nreasonable certainty by any words or acts (a) an intention on his part to create thereby a trust, (b) the\npurpose of the trust, (c) the beneficiary, and (d) the trust-property, and (unless the trust is declared by\n\nwill or the author of the trust is himself to be the trustee) transfers the trust- property to the trustee.\nIllustrations\n\n(a) A bequeaths certain property to B, “having the fullest confidence that he will dispose of it for the\nbenefit of C”. This creates a trust so far as regards A and C.\n(b) A bequeaths certain property to B, “hoping he will continue it in the family”. This does not create a\n\ntrust, as the beneficiary is not indicated with reasonable certainty.\n\n(c) A bequeaths certain property to B, requesting him to distribute it among such members of C's family\nas B should think most deserving. This does not create a trust, for the beneficiaries are not indicated\n\nwith reasonable certainty.\n\n(d) A bequeaths certain property to B, desiring him to divide the bulk of it among C's children. This does\n\nnot create a trust, for the trust-property is not indicated with sufficient certainty.\n\n(e) A bequeaths a shop and stock-in-trade to B, on condition that he pays A's debts and a legacy to C.\n\nThis is a condition, not a trust for A's creditors and C.\n\n7. Atrust may be created-\n\n(a) by every person competent to contract, and,\n\n(b) with the permission of a principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction, by or on behalf of a minor;\n\n4/46\n\n30/08/2025\n\nSubject of trust\n\nWho may be\nbeneficiary\n\nDisclaimer by\n\nbeneficiary\n\nWho may be\ntrustee\n\nNo one bound to\naccept trust\nAcceptance of\n\ntrust\n\nDisclaimer of\ntrust\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-47.html\n\nThe Trusts Act, 1882\n\nbut subject in each case to the law for the time being in force as to the circumstances and extent in and\n\nto which the author of the trust may dispose of the trust —property.\n\n8. The subject-matter of a trust must be properly transferable to the beneficiary.\n\nIt must not be merely beneficial interest under a subsisting trust.\n\n9. Every person capable of holding property may be a beneficiary.\n\nA proposed beneficiary may renounce his interest under the trust by disclaimer addressed to the\n\ntrustee, or by setting up, with notice of the trust, a claim inconsistent therewith.\n\n10. Every person capable of holding property may be a trustee; but, where the trust involves the\n\nexercise of discretion, he cannot execute it unless he is competent to contract.\n\nNo one is bound to accept a trust.\n\nA trust is accepted by any words or acts of the trustee indicating with reasonable certainty such\n\nacceptance.\n\nInstead of accepting a trust, the intended trustee may, within a reasonable period, disclaim it, and such\n\ndisclaimer shall prevent the trust-property from vesting in him.\n\nA disclaimer by one of two or more co-trustees vests the trust-property in the other or others, and\n\nmakes him or them sole trustee or trustees from the date of the creation of the trust.\n\nIllustrations\n\n5/46\n\n30/08/2025\n\nTrustee to\nexecute trust\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-47.html\n\nThe Trusts Act, 1882\n\n(a) A bequeaths certain property to B and C, his executors, as trustees for D. B and C prove A's will.\n\nThis is in itself an acceptance of the trust, and B and C hold the property in trust for D.\n\n(b) A transfers certain property to B in trust to sell it and to pay out of the proceeds A's debts. B accepts\n\nthe trust and sells the property. So far as regards B, a trust of the proceeds is created for A's creditors.\n\n(c) A bequeaths a lakh of Taka to B upon certain trusts and appoints him his executor. B severs the lakh\n\nfrom the general assets and appropriates it to the specific purpose. This is an acceptance of the trust.\n\nCHAPTER IIl\nOF THE DUTIES AND LIABILITIES OF TRUSTEES\n\n11. The trustee is bound to fulfil the purpose of the trust, and to obey the directions of the author of the\ntrust given at the time of its creation, except as modified by the consent of all the beneficiaries being\n\ncompetent to contract.\n\nWhere the beneficiary is incompetent to contract, his consent may, for the purposes of this section, be\ngiven by a principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction.\n\nNothing in this section shall be deemed to require a trustee to obey any direction when to do so would\nbe impracticable, illegal or manifestly injurious to the beneficiaries.\n\nExplanation - Unless a contrary intention be expressed, the purpose of a trust for the payment of debts\nshall be deemed to be (a) to pay only the debts of the author of the trust existing and recoverable at the\ndate of the instrument of trust, or, when such instrument is a will, at the date of his death, and (b) in the\n\ncase of debts not bearing interest, to make such payment without interest.\n\nIllustrations\n\n6/46\n\n30/08/2025\n\nTrustee to inform\nhimself of state of\ntrust-property\n\nTrustee to protect\ntitle to trust-\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-47.html\n\nThe Trusts Act, 1882\n\n(a) A, a trustee, is simply authorised to sell certain land by public auction. He cannot sell the land by\n\nprivate contract.\n\n(b) A, a trustee of certain land for X, Y and Z, is authorised to sell the land to B for a specified sum. X, Y\nand Z, being competent to contract, consent that A may sell the land to C for a less sum. A may sell the\n\nland accordingly.\n\n(c) A, a trustee for B and her children, is directed by the author of the trust to lend, on B's request, trust-\nproperty to B's husband, C, on the security of his bond. C becomes insolvent and B requests A to make\n\nthe loan. A may refuse to make it.\n\n12. A trustee is bound to acquaint himself, as soon as possible, with the nature and circumstances of\nthe trust-property; to obtain, where necessary, a transfer of the trust-property to himself; and (subject to\nthe provisions of the instrument of trust) to get in trust-moneys invested on insufficient or hazardous\n\nsecurity.\nIllustrations\n\n(a) The trust-property is a debt outstanding on personal security. The instrument of trust gives the\ntrustee no discretionary power to leave the debt so outstanding. The trustee's duty is to recover the\n\ndebt without un-necessary delay.\n\n(b) The trust-property is money in the hands of one of two co-trustees. No discretionary power is given\nby the instrument of trust. The other co-trustee must not allow the former to retain the money for a\n\nlonger period than the circumstances of the case required.\n\n13. A trustee is bound to maintain and defend all such suits, and (subject to the provisions of the\n\ninstrument of trust) to take such other steps as, regard being had to the nature and amount or value of\n\n7/46\n\n30/08/2025\n\nproperty\n\nTrustee not to set\nup title adverse to\nbeneficiary\n\nCare required\nfrom trustee\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-47.html\n\nThe Trusts Act, 1882\n\nthe trust-property, may be reasonably requisite for the preservation of the trust-property and the\n\nassertion or protection of the title thereto.\nIllustration\n\nThe trust-property is immoveable property which has been given to the author of the trust by an\nunregistered instrument. Subject to the provisions of the *[Registration Act, 1908], the trustee's duty is\n\nto cause the instrument to be registered.\n\n14. The trustee must not for himself or another set up or aid any title to the trust-property adverse to the\n\ninterest of the beneficiary.\n\n15. A trustee is bound to deal with the trust-property as carefully as a man of ordinary prudence would\ndeal with such property if it were his own; and, in the absence of a contract to the contrary, a trustee so\ndealing is not responsible for the loss, destruction or deterioration of the trust-property.\n\nIllustrations\n\n(a) A, living in Chittagong, is a trustee for B, living in 4[Dhaka]. A remits trust-funds to B by bills drawn\nby a person of undoubted credit in favour of the trustee as such, and payable at *[Dhaka]. The bills are\ndis-honoured. A is not bound to make good the loss.\n\n(b) A, a trustee of leasehold property, directs the tenant to pay the rents on account of the trust to a\nbanker, B, then in credit. The rents are accordingly paid to B, and A leaves the money with B only till\nwanted. Before the money is drawn out, B becomes insolvent. A, having had no reason to believe that\nB was in insolvent circumstances, is not bound to make good the loss.\n\n(c) A, a trustee of two debts for B, releases one and compounds the other, in good faith, and\n\nreasonably believing that it is for B's interest to do so. Ais not bound to make good any loss caused\n\n8/46\n\n30/08/2025\n\nConversion of\nperishable\nproperty\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-47.html\n\nThe Trusts Act, 1882\n\nthereby to B.\n\n(d) A, a trustee directed to sell the trust-property by auction, sells the same, but does not advertise the\nsale and otherwise fails in reasonable diligence in inviting competition. A is bound to make good the\n\nloss caused thereby to the beneficiary.\n\n(e) A, a trustee for B, in execution of his trust, sells the trust-property, but from want of due diligence on\nhis part fails to receive part of the purchase-money. A is bound to make good the loss thereby caused\n\nto B.\n\n(f) A, a trustee for B of a policy of insurance, has funds in hand for payment of the premiums. A\nneglects to pay the premiums, and the policy is consequently forfeited. A is bound to make good the\n\nloss to B.\n\n(g) A bequeaths certain moneys to B and C as trustees, and authorizes them to continue trust-moneys\nupon the personal security of a certain firm in which A had himself invested them. A dies, and a change\ntakes place in the firm. B and C must not permit the moneys to remain upon the personal security of\n\nthe new firm.\n\n(h) A, a trustee for B, allows the trust to be executed solely by this co-trustee, C. C misapplies the trust-\n\nproperty. Ais personally answerable for the loss resulting to B.\n\n16. Where the trust is created for the benefit of several persons in succession, and the trust-property is\nof a wasting nature or a future or reversionary interest, the trustee is bound, unless an intention to the\ncontrary may be inferred from the instrument of trust, to convert the property into property of a\n\npermanent and immediately profitable character.\n\nIllustrations\n\n9/46\n\n30/08/2025\n\nTrustee to be\nimpartial\n\nTrustee to\nprevent waste\n\nAccounts and\ninformation\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-47.html\n\nThe Trusts Act, 1882\n\n(a) A bequeaths to B all his property in trust for C during his life, and on his death for D, and on D's\ndeath for E. A's property consists of three leasehold houses, and there is nothing in A's will to show that\nhe intended the houses to be enjoyed in specie. B should sell the houses, and invest the proceeds in\n\naccordance with section 20.\n\n(b) A bequeaths to B his three leasehold houses in Chittagong and all the furniture therein in trust for C\nduring his life, and on his death for D, and on D's death for E. Here an intention that the houses and\n\nfurniture should be enjoyed in specie appears clearly, and B should not sell them.\n\n17. Where there are more beneficiaries than one, the trustee is bound to be impartial, and must not\n\nexecute the trust for the advantage of one at the expense of another.\n\nWhere the trustee has a discretionary power, nothing in this section shall be deemed to authorise the\n\nCourt to control the exercise reasonably and in good faith of such discretion.\nIllustration\n\nA, a trustee for B, C and D, is empowered to choose between several specified modes of investing the\ntrust-property. A in good faith chooses one of the these modes. The Court will not interfere, although\n\nthe result of the choice may be to vary the relative rights of B, C and D.\n\n18. Where the trust is created for the benefit of several persons in succession and one of them is in\npossession of the trust-property, if he commits, or threatens to commit, any act which is destructive or\n\npermanently injurious thereto, the trustee is bound to take measures to prevent such act.\n\n19. A trustee is bound (a) to keep clear and accurate accounts of the trust-property, and (b), at all\n\nreasonable times, at the request of the beneficiary, to furnish him with full and accurate information as\n\n10/46\n\n30/08/2025\n\nInvestment of\ntrust-money\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-47.html\n\nto the amount and state of the trust-property. —\n20. Where the trust-property consists of money and cannot be applied immediately or at an early date\nto the purposes of the trust, the trustee is bound (subject to any direction contained in the instrument of\n\ntrust) to invest the money on the following securities, and on no others:-\n\n(a) in promissory notes, debentures, stock or other securities [of the Government]:\n\nProvided that securities, both the principal whereof and the interest whereon shall have been fully and\nun-conditionally guaranteed by ’[the] Government, shall be deemed, for the purposes of this clause, to\nbe securities of §[the] Government;\n\nopt * 4]\n\n10(c) in stock or debentures of, or shares in, Companies the interest whereon shall have been\nguaranteed by the Government:\n\n(d) in debenture or other securities for money issued under the authority of any Bangladesh Act, or on\nbehalf of any municipal body or port trust or city improvement trust: ]\n\n(e) on a first mortgage of immoveable property situate in [Bangladesh]: Provided that the property is\nnot a leasehold for a term of years and that the value of the property exceeds by one-third, or, if\nconsisting of buildings, exceeds by one-half, the mortgage-money; or\n\n(f) on any other security expressly authorised by the instrument of trust, or by any rule which the\n12/Supreme Court] may from time to time prescribe in this behalf:\n\nProvided that, where there is a person competent to contract and entitled in possession to receive the\nincome of the trust-property for his life, or for any greater estate, no investment on any security\n\nmentioned or referred to in clauses (d), (e), and (f) shall be made without his consent in writing.\n\n11/46\n\n30/08/2025\n\nPower to\npurchase\nredeemable stock\nat a premium\n\nInvestment of\ntrust-money in\ncompany\nsecurities\n\nDeposit in\nGovernment\nSavings Bank\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-47.html\n\nThe Trusts Act, 1882\n\n13(20A.(1) A trustee may invest in any of the securities mentioned or referred to in section 20,\n\nnotwithstanding that the same may be redeemable and that the price exceeds the redemption value:\n\nProvided that a trustee may not purchase at a price exceeding its redemption value any security\nmentioned or referred to in clauses (c) and (d) of section 20 which is liable to be redeemed within\nfifteen years of the date of purchase at par or at some other fixed rate, or purchase any such security\nas is mentioned or referred to in the said clauses which is liable to be redeemed at par or at some other\n\nfixed rate at a price exceeding fifteen per centum above par or such other fixed rate.\n\n(2) A trustee may retain until redemption any redeemable stock, fund or security which may have been\n\npurchased in accordance with this section.]\n\n14720B. (1) Where the trust property comprises money and it cannot be applied immediately to the\npurposes of the trust, the trustee may, subject to any prohibition or restriction imposed in the instrument\nof trust, invest an amount not exceeding 25% of such money, hereinafter referred to in this section as\nthe maximum limit of investment, in any security listed with a stock exchange of Bangladesh.\n\n(2) In determining the exact amount of money that may be invested under sub-section (1) at any given\ntime, the money already invested, if any, under this section and also under 20(f) shall be deducted from\nthe maximum limit of investment at that time.\n\n(3) Nothing in this section shall be construed to be a bar to authorise the investment of trust-money by\n\nthe author of the trust beyond the maximum limit of investment.]\n\n21.

Where a trustee directed to sell within a specified time extends such time, the burden of proving, as\nbetween himself and the beneficiary, that the latter is not prejudiced by the extension lies upon the\n\ntrustee, unless the extension has been authorised by a principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction.\nIllustration\n\nA bequeaths property to B, directing him with all convenient speed and within five years to sell it, and\napply the proceeds for the benefit of C. In the exercise of reasonable discretion, B postpones the sale\nfor six years. The sale is not thereby rendered invalid, but C, alleging that he has been injured by the\npostponement, institutes a suit against B to obtain compensation. In such suit the burden of proving\n\nthat C has not been injured lies on B.\n\n23. Where the trustee commits a breach of trust, he is liable to make good the loss which the trust-\nproperty or the beneficiary has thereby sustained, unless the beneficiary has by fraud induced the\ntrustee to commit the breach, or the beneficiary, being competent to contract, has himself, without\ncoercion or undue influence having been brought to bear on him, concurred in the breach, or\nsubsequently acquiesced therein, with full knowledge of the facts of the case and of his right as against\n\nthe trustee.\n\nA trustee committing a breach of trust is not liable to pay interest except in the following cases:-\n(a) where he has actually received interest:\n\n(b) where the breach consists in unreasonable delay in paying trust-money to the beneficiary:\n(c) where the trustee ought to have received interest, but has not done so:\n\n(d) where he may be fairly presumed to have received interest.\n\n13/46\n\n30/08/2025\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-47.html\n\nThe Trusts Act, 1882\n\nHe is liable, in case (a), to account for the interest actually received, and, in cases (b), (c) and (d), to\n\naccount for simple interest at the rate of six per cent. per annum, unless Court otherwise directs.\n\n(e) where the breach consists in failure to invest trust-money and to accumulate the interest or\ndividends thereon, he is liable to account for compound interest (with half-yearly rests) at the same\n\nrate.\n\n(f) where the breach consists in the employment of trust-property or the proceeds thereof in trade or\nbusiness, he is liable to account, at the option of the beneficiary, either for compound interest (with half-\n\nyearly rests) at the same rate, or for the net profits made by such employment.\nIllustrations\n\n(a) A trustee improperly leaves trust-property outstanding, and it is consequently lost: he is liable to\n\nmake good the property lost, but he is not liable to pay interest thereon.\n\n(b) A bequeaths a house to B in trust to sell it and pay the proceeds to C. B neglects to sell the house\nfor a great length of time, whereby the house is deteriorated and its market price falls. B is answerable\n\nto C for the loss.\n\n(c) A trustee is guilty of unreasonable delay in investing trust-money in accordance with section 20, or\n\nin paying it to the beneficiary. The trustee is liable to pay interest thereon for the period of the delay.\n\n(d) The duty of the trustee is to invest trust-money in any of the securities mentioned in section 20,\nclause (a), (b), (c) or (d). Instead of so doing he retains the money in his hands. He is liable, at the\noption of the beneficiary, to be charged either with the amount of the principal money and interest, or\nwith the amount of such securities as he might have purchased with the trust-money when the\n\ninvestment should have been made, and the intermediate dividends and interest thereon.\n\n14/46\n\n30/08/2025\n\nNo set-off\nallowed to trustee\n\nNon-liability for\npredecessor’s\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-47.html\n\nThe Trusts Act, 1882\n\n(e) The instrument of trust directs the trustee to invest trust-money either in any such securities or on\nmortgage of immoveable property. The trustee does neither. He is liable for the principal money and\n\ninterest.\n\n(f) The instrument of trust directs the trustee to invest trust-money in any of such securities and to\naccumulate the dividends thereon. the trustee disregards the direction.

When any beneficiary's interest becomes vested in another person, and the trustee, not having\nnotice of the vesting, pays or delivers trust-property to the person who would have been entitled thereto\n\nin the absence of such vesting, the trustee is not liable for the property so paid or delivered.\n\n29.

A trustee is entitled to have in his possession the instrument of trust and all the documents of title (if\n\nany) relating solely to the trust-property.\n\nWhere a trustee has by mistake made an over-payment to the beneficiary, he may reimburse the trust-\nproperty out of the beneficiary's interest. If such interest fail, the trustee is entitled to recover from the\n\nbeneficiary personally the amount of such over-payment.\n\n32. Every trustee may reimburse himself, or pay or discharge out of the trust-property, all expenses\nproperly incurred in or about the execution of the trust, or the realisation, preservation or benefit of the\n\ntrust-property, or the protection or support of the beneficiary.\n\nIf he pays such expenses out of his own pocket, he has a first charge upon the trust-property for such\nexpenses and interest thereon; but such charge (unless the expenses have been incurred with the\nsanction of a principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction) shall be enforced only by prohibiting any\n\ndisposition of the trust-property without previous payment of such expenses and interest.\n\n18/46\n\n30/08/2025\n\nRight to\nindemnity from\ngainer by breach\nof trust\n\nRight to apply to\nCourt for opinion\nin management of\ntrust-property\n\nRight to\nsettlement of\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-47.html\n\nThe Trusts Act, 1882\n\nIf the trust-property fail, the trustee is entitled to recover from the beneficiary personally on whose\nbehalf he acted, and at whose request, expressed or implied, he made the payment, the amount of\n\nsuch expenses.\n\n33. A person other than a trustee who has gained an advantage from a breach of trust must indemnify\nthe trustee to the extent of the amount actually received by such person under the breach; and where\n\nhe is a beneficiary the trustee has a charge on his interest for such amount.\n\nNothing in this section shall be deemed to entitle a trustee to be indemnified who has, in committing the\n\nbreach of trust, been guilty of fraud.\n\n34. Any trustee may, without instituting a suit, apply by petition to a principal Civil Court of original\njurisdiction for its opinion, advice or direction on any present questions respecting the management or\nadministration of the trust-property other than questions of detail, difficulty or importance, not proper in\n\nthe opinion of the Court for summary disposal.\n\nA copy of such petition shall be served upon, and the hearing thereof may be attended by, such of the\n\npersons interested in the application as the Court thinks fit.\n\nThe trustee stating in good faith the facts in such petition and acting upon the opinion, advice or\ndirection given by the Court shall be deemed, so far as regards his own responsibility, to have\n\ndischarged his duty as such trustee in the subject-matter of the application.\n\nThe costs of every application under this section shall be in the discretion of the Court to which it is\n\nmade.\n\n19/46\n\naccounts\n\nGeneral authority\nof trustee\n\nPower to sell in\nlots, and either by\npublic auction or\nprivate contract\n\nPower to sell\nunder special\nconditions Power\nto buy in and re-\nsell\n\nTime allowed for\nselling trust-\nproperty\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-47.html\n\nThe Trusts Act, 1882\n\n35. When the duties of a trustee, as such, are completed, he is entitled to have the accounts of his\nadministration of the trust-property examined and settled; and, where nothing is due to the beneficiary\n\nunder the trust, to an acknowledgement in writing to that effect.\n\n36. In addition to the powers expressly conferred by this Act and by the instrument of trust, and subject\nto the restrictions, if any, contained in such instrument, and to the provisions of section 17, a trustee\nmay do all acts which are reasonable and proper for the realisation, protection or benefit of the trust-\n\nproperty, and for the protection or support of a beneficiary who is not competent to contract.\n\nExcept with the permission of a principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction, no trustee shall lease trust-\nproperty for a term exceeding twenty-one years from the date of executing the lease, nor without\n\nreserving the best yearly rent that can be reasonably obtained.\n\n37. Where the trustee is empowered to sell any trust-property, he may sell the same subject to prior\ncharges or not, and either together or in lots, by public auction or private contract, and either at one\n\ntime or at several times, unless the instrument of trust otherwise directs.\n\n38. The trustee making any such sale may insert such reasonable stipulations either as to title or\nevidence of title, or otherwise, in any conditions of sale or contract for sale, as he thinks fit; and may\nalso buy in the property or any part thereof at any sale by auction, and rescind or vary any contract for\nsale, and re-sell the property so bought in, or as to which the contract is so rescinded, without being\n\nresponsible to the beneficiary for any loss occasioned thereby.\n\nWhere a trustee is directed to sell trust-property or to invest trust-money in the purchase of property, he\n\nmay exercise a reasonable discretion as to the time of effecting the sale or purchase.\n\n20/46\n\n30/08/2025\n\nPower to convey\n\nPower to vary\ninvestments\n\nPower to apply\nproperty of\nminors, etc., for\ntheir\n\nmaintenance, etc.\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-47.html\n\nThe Trusts Act, 1882\n\nIllustrations\n\n(a) A bequeaths property to B, directing him to sell it with all convenient speed and pay the proceeds to\n\nC.

This does not authorise B, as between him and C, to\n\npostpone the sale to an indefinite period.\n\n39. For the purpose of completing any such sale, the trustee shall have power to convey or otherwise\n\ndispose of the property sold in such manner as may be necessary.\n\n40. A trustee may, at his discretion, call in any trust-property invested in any security and invest the\nsame on any of the securities mentioned or referred to in section 20, and from time to time vary any\n\nsuch investments for others of the same nature:\n\nProvided that, where there is a person competent to contract and entitled at the time to receive the\nincome of the trust-property for his life, or for any greater estate, no such change of investment shall be\n\nmade without his consent in writing.\n\n41. Where any property is held by a trustee in trust for a minor, such trustee may, at his discretion, pay\nto the guardians (if any) of such minor, or otherwise apply for or towards his maintenance or education\nor advancement in life, or the reasonable expenses of his religious worship, marriage or funeral, the\nwhole or any part of the income to which he may be entitled in respect of such property; and such\ntrustee shall accumulate all the residue of such income by way of compound interest by investing the\n\nsame and the resulting income thereof from time to time in any of the securities mentioned or referred\n\n21/46\n\n30/08/2025\n\nPower to give\nreceipts\n\nPower to\ncompound, etc.\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-47.html\n\nThe Trusts Act, 1882\n\nto in section 20, for the benefit of the person who shall ultimately become entitled to the property from\n\nwhich such accumulations have arisen:\n\nProvided that such trustee may, at any time, if he thinks fit, apply the whole or any part of such\n\naccumulations as if the same were part of the income arising in the then current year.\n\nWhere the income of the trust-property is insufficient for the minor's maintenance or education or\nadvancement in life, or the reasonable expenses of his religious worship, marriage or funeral, the\ntrustee may, with the permission of a principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction, but not otherwise,\napply the whole or any part of such property for or towards such maintenance, education, advancement\n\nor expenses.\n\nNothing in this section shall be deemed to affect the provisions of any local law for the time being in\n\nforce relating to the persons and property of minors.\n\n42. Any trustees or trustee may give a receipt in writing for any money, securities or other moveable\nproperty payable, transferable or deliverable to them or him by reason, or in the exercise, of any trust\nor power; and, in the absence of fraud, such receipt shall discharge the person paying, transferring or\ndelivering the same therefrom, and from seeing to the application thereof, or being accountable for any\n\nloss or misapplication thereof.\n\n43.

When an authority to deal with the trust-property is given to several trustees and one of them\ndisclaims or dies, the authority may be exercised by the continuing trustees, unless from the terms of\nthe instrument of trust it is apparent that the authority is to be exercised by a number in excess of the\n\nnumber of the remaining trustees.\n\n45. Where a decree has been made in a suit for the execution of a trust, the trustee must not exercise\nany of his powers except in conformity with such decree, or with the sanction of the Court by which the\n\ndecree has been made, or, where an appeal against the decree is pending, of the Appellate Court.\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n23/46\n\n30/08/2025\nTrustee cannot\n\nrenounce after\nacceptance\n\nTrustee cannot\ndelegate\n\nCo-trustees\ncannot act singly\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-47.html\n\nOF THE DISABILITIES OF TRUSTEES’\n\n46.

The beneficiary, if competent to contract, may transfer his interest, but subject to the law for the\n\ntime being in force as to the circumstances and extent in and to which he may dispose of such interest:\n\nProvided that when property is transferred or bequeathed for the benefit of a married woman, so that\nshe shall not have power to deprive herself of her beneficial interest, nothing in this section shall\n\nauthorise her to transfer such interest during her marriage.\n\n59. Where no trustees are appointed or all the trustees die, disclaim, or are discharged, or where for\nany other reason the execution of a trust by the trustee is or becomes impracticable, the beneficiary\nmay institute a suit for the execution of the trust, and the trust shall, so far as may be possible, be\n\nexecuted by the Court until the appointment of a trustee or new trustee.\n\n60.

B may sue on behalf of himself and C for an\n\ninjunction to restrain A from making the sale.\n\n62. Where a trustee has wrongfully bought trust-property, the beneficiary has a right to have the\nproperty declared subject to the trust or retransferred by the trustee, if it remains in his hands unsold,\nor, if it has been bought from him by any person with notice or the trust, by such person. But in such\ncase the beneficiary must repay the purchase-money paid by the trustee, with interest, and such other\nexpenses (if any) as he has properly incurred in the preservation of the property; and the trustee or\npurchaser must (a) account for the net profits of the property, (b) be charged with an occupation-rent, if\n\nhe has been in actual possession of the property, and (c) allow the\n\nbeneficiary to deduct a proportionate part of the purchase-money if the property has been deteriorated\n\nby the acts or omissions of the trustee or purchaser.\nNothing in this section-\n\n(a) impairs the rights of lessees and others who, before the institution of a suit to have the property\n\ndeclared subject to the trust or retransferred, have contracted in good faith with the trustee or\n\n29/46\n\n30/08/2025\n\nFollowing trust-\nproperty- into the\nhands of third\npersons; into that\ninto which it has\nbeen converted\n\nSaving of rights\nof certain\ntransferees\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-47.html\n\nThe Trusts Act, 1882\n\npurchaser; or\n\n(b) entitles the beneficiary to have the property declared subject to the trust or retransferred where he,\nbeing competent to contract, has himself, without coercion or undue influence having been brought to\nbear on him, ratified the sale to the trustee with full Knowledge of the facts of the case and of his rights\n\nas against the trustee.\n\n63. Where trust-property comes into the hands of a third person inconsistently with the trust, the\nbeneficiary may require him to admit formally, or may institute a suit for a declaration, that the property\n\nis comprised in the trust.\n\nWhere the trustee has disposed of trust-property and the money or other property which he has\nreceived therefor can be traced in his hands, or the hands of his legal representative or legatee, the\nbeneficiary has, in respect thereof, rights as merely as may be the same as his rights in respect of the\n\noriginal trust-property.\nIllustrations\n\n(a) A, a trustee for B of Tk. 10,000, wrongfully invests Tk. 10,000 in the purchase of certain land..

On the death or discharge of one of several co-trustees, the trust survives and the trust-property\n\npasses to the others, unless the instrument of trust expressly declares otherwise.\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nOF THE EXTINCTION OF TRUSTS\n\n77.

An obligation in the nature of a trust is created in the following cases.\n\n81. Where the owner of property transfers or bequeaths it and it cannot be inferred consistently with the\nattendant circumstances that he intended to dispose of the beneficial interest therein, the transferee or\n\nlegatee must hold such property for the benefit of the owner or his legal representative.\nIllustration\n\n(a) A conveys land to B without consideration and declares no trust of any part. It cannot, consistently\nwith the circumstances under which the transfer is made, be inferred that A intended to transfer the\n\nbeneficial interest in the land. B holds the land for the benefit of A.\n\n(b) A conveys to B two fields, Y and Z, and declares a trust of Y, but says nothing about Z. It cannot,\nconsistently with the circumstances under which the transfer is made, be inferred that A intended to\n\ntransfer the beneficial interest in Z. B holds Z for the benefit of A.\n\n(c) A transfers certain stock belonging to him into the joint names of himself and B. It cannot,\nconsistently with the circumstances under which the transfer is made, be inferred that A intended to\ntransfer the beneficial interest in the stock during his life. A and B hold the stock for the benefit of A\n\nduring his life.\n\n38/46\n\n30/08/2025 The Trusts Act, 1882\n\n(d) A makes a gift of certain land to his wife B. She takes the beneficial interest in the land free from\n\nany trust in favour of A, for it may be inferred from the circumstances that the gift was for B's benefit.\n\nTransfer to one 82. Where property is transferred to one person for a consideration paid or provided by another person,\nfor consideration\n. and it appears that such other person did not intend to pay or provide such consideration for the benefit\npaid by another\n\nof the transferee, the transferee must hold the property for the benefit of the person paying or provided\n\nthe consideration.\n\n167 * *]\n\nTrust incapable of = 33.

Where the owner of property transfers it to another for an illegal purpose and such purpose is not\ncarried into execution, or the transferor is not as guilty as the transferee, or the effect of permitting the\ntransferee to retain the property might be to defeat the provisions of any law, the transferee must hold\n\nthe property for the benefit of the transferor.\n\n85. Where a testator bequeaths certain property upon trust and the purpose of the trust appears on the\nface of the will to be unlawful, or during the testator's lifetime the legatee agrees with him to apply the\nproperty for an unlawful purpose, the legatee must hold the property for the benefit of the testator's\n\nlegal representative.\n\nWhere property is bequeathed and the revocation of the bequest is prevented by coercion, the legatee\n\nmust hold the property for the benefit of the testator's legal representative.\n\n40/46\n\n30/08/2025\n\nTransfer pursuant\nto rescindable\ncontract\n\nDebtor becoming\ncreditor’s\nrepresentative\n\nAdvantage\n\ngained by\nfiduciary\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-47.html\n\nThe Trusts Act, 1882\n\n86.

A holds the lease for the\n\nbenefit of B.\n\n(h) A, a guardian, buys up for himself incumbrances on his ward B's estate at an undervalue. A holds\nfor the benefit of B the incumbrances so bought, and can only charge him with what he has actually\n\npaid.\n\n89.

Where a tenant for life, co-owner, mortgagee or other qualified owner of any property, by availing\nhimself of his position as such, gains an advantage in derogation of the rights of the other persons\ninterested in the property, or where any such owner, as representing all persons interested in such\nproperty, gains any advantage, he must hold, for the benefit of all persons so interested, the advantage\n\nso gained, but subject to repayment by such persons of their due share of the expenses properly\n\n42/46\n\n30/08/2025\n\nProperty acquired\nwith notice of\nexisting contract\n\nPurchase by\nperson\ncontracting to\nbuy property to\nbe held on trust\n\nAdvantage\nsecretly gained\nby one of several\n\nbdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-47.html\n\nThe Trusts Act, 1882\n\nincurred, and to an indemnity by the same persons against liabilities properly contracted, in gaining\n\nsuch advantage.\nIllustrations\n\n(a) A, the tenant for life of leasehold property, renews the lease in this own name and for his own\n\nbenefit.
