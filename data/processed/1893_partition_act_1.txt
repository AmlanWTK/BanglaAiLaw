(4) But nothing herein contained shall be deemed to affect any [other] law providing for the partition of

2. Wherever in any suit for partition in which, if instituted prior to the commencement of this Act, a

circumstance, a division of the property cannot reasonably or conveniently be made, and that a sale of

the property, and distribution of the proceeds would be more beneficial for all the shareholders, the

collectively to the extent of one moiety or upwards, direct a sale of the property and a distribution of the

proceeds.

any other shareholder applies for leave to buy at a valuation the share or shares of the party or parties
asking for a sale, the Court shall order a valuation of the share or shares in such manner as it may
think fit and offer to sell the same to such shareholder at the price so ascertained, and may give all

necessary and proper directions in that behalf.

Court shall order a sale of the share or shares to the shareholder who offers to pay the highest price

applicant or applicants shall be liable to pay all costs of or incident to the application or applications.

4. (1) Where a share of a dwelling-house belonging to an undivided family has been transferred to a
person who is not a member of such family and such transferee sues for partition, the Court shall, if
any member of the family being a shareholder shall undertake to buy the share of such transferee,
make a valuation of such share in such manner as it thinks fit and direct the sale of such share to such
shareholder, and may give all necessary and proper directions in that behalf.

(2) If in any case describes in sub-section (1) two or more members of the family being such

5. In any suit for partition a request for sale may be made or an undertaking, or application for leave, to
buy may be given or made on behalf of any party under disability by any person authorized to act on
behalf of such party in such suit, but the Court shall not be bound to comply with any such request,
undertaking or application unless it is of opinion that the sale or purchase will be for the benefit of the

party under such disability.

6. (1) Every sale under section 2 shall be subject to a reserved bidding, and the amount of such bidding
shall be fixed by the Court in such manner as it may think fit and may be varied from time to time.

(2) On any such sale any of the shareholders shall be at liberty to bid at the sale on such terms as to
non-payment of deposit or as to setting off or accounting for the purchase-money or any part thereof
instead of paying the same as to the Court may seem reasonable.

(3) If two or more persons, of whom one is a shareholder in the property, respectively advance the
same sum at any bidding at such sale, such bidding shall be deemed to be the bidding of the

shareholder.
